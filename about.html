    <h2 id="about">about me</h2>
      <p>hello! My name is lipamanka. I'm a nutorious toki pona linguist. I'm from New York. I practice Judaism and Witchcraft and I hate Israelüçâüçâüçâ! I am good at cooking and I speak some languages, including toki pona, Brazillian Portuguese, and Tok Pisin. If you need to contact me for any reason, my discord is @lipamanka. You can also email me: lipamanka at gmail dot com.</p>

      <p>There are a few other writers for this website. None of them want their contact information listed. If you know, you know. If you don't and want to talk to them anyway, just let me know and I can put you in touch with them.</p>

      <p>Here are some toki pona related projects I have either made or taken part in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I created my <a href="https://lipamanka.gay/essays/dictionary">semantic spaces dictionary</a>, the first dicitonary for toki pona that describes the meaning of all common words in prose instead of having a list of words in a different language (featured on <a href="https://tokipona.org">tokipona.org</a>) and many other resources available on this website</li>
        <li>I helped with many of the definitions on <a href="https://linku.la">linku.la</a></li>
        <li>I contributed to the Toki Pona Dictionary and The Wizard of Oz: Toki Pona Edition, both written by Sonja Lang</li>
        <li>I got third place in a writing contest (<a href="https://utala.pona.la/mamtt/lipu-musi/lipu-suli/jan-Eto-li-alasa-e-pipi.html">here</a> is my submission)</li>
        <li>I have designed the logos for kalama sin and the discord servers "ma pali" and "sona.pona.la," and some more of my sitelen suwi art can be seen on the walls of some VR chat worlds as decoration (also featured on <a href="https://jonathangabel.com/toki-pona/colors/">Jonathan Gabel's website</a>).</li>
        <li>I've made two popular fonts: linja sike and linja lipamanka, both known for high levels of interaction with community ideas and submissions (including a couple dozen community submitted jaki and ko glyphs in linja lipamanka) and the popularization of name glyphs</li>
        <li>Along with Sonja Lang and two other tokiponists (ijo Mina and jan Sa), I developed the official sitelen pona glyph for <em>ku</em> in 2021</li>
        <li>I've attended toki pona meetups in Washington DC, San Francisco, and Chicago</li>
        <li>I am a maintainer of linku and nimi ale pona, and I also own "nimi ale," an obscure dictionary of rare nimisin originating in the discord server known as "ma pona pi toki pona" compiled completely by <a href="https://lipu-pi-ijo-pi-toki.pona.la/">kule epiku Atawan</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>wow that's a lot more than I was expecting. what the fuck?</p>

      <p>Fun facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I own more than 10 pounds of spices from all over the world</li>
        <li>I can cite an American Multinational Conservative News and Political Commentary Television Channel and Website for my pronouns</li>
        <li>I am close friends with Rasputin's ghost</li>
        <li>I get posessed frequently. You think I'm joking and that's cute.</li>
        <li>I have in the past constructed a lazy suzan out of wood and metal and blood and sweat no tears</li>
        <li>I am redoing my website one page at a time :) this is page number three</li>
        <li>I paint a lot. Expect to see painting stuff on my website.</li>
        <li>I did not commit grand Larceny in 2019 and 2022.</li>
        <li>I can play most wind instruments</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The Israeli government and millitary has killed over 40,000 Palestinians. It's genuinely horrible and heartbreaking to see people using ~200 hostages as a means of distraction. It's genuinely frightening and emotionally explosive to hear people cite real and dangerous rising antisemitism as a reason to side with Israel, a terrorist state that does not stand for all Jews. It's frustrating that people will call (and have called) me a self-hating Jew for disliking Israel. I'm never going to forgive Israel for this. Israel has always been an an evil colonial state.</p>
