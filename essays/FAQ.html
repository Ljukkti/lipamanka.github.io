        <summary>There are a lot of misconseptions about toki pona, from what it is, to what it is capable of, to what it's for. The philosophy of the language runs deep, and I hope to answer some questions about it here.</summary>

              <h3 id="what-is-toki-pona">Q - What is toki pona?</h3>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - toki pona is a language, just like many others. Two main things set it apart from most other languages:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>toki pona was created by one person with a specific goal in mind</li>
                <li>toki pona has an extremely small vocabulary.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>toki pona has lots of other qualities that make it unique, and if you keep reading, you'll learn about many of them! Usually the information I've shared so far sparks curiosity. If you have any questions that aren't answered in this page, please fill out <a href="https://lipamanka.gay/essays/FAQ#form">the question submission form below</a> and I will likely add it to this page as quickly as I can.</p>
              <p>That being said, people usually have <strong>Follow-Up questions. You can find all of the most common follow-up questions below.</strong></p>

                  <summary id="how-many-words">Q - So how many words does toki pona have?</summary>
                  <p><strong>A</strong> - Like, around 120. Some people get mad at this number. There are a lot of words out there, and a lot of them are in use. In the official toki pona dictionary, toki pona is shown to have 137 "essential" words and an additional few dozen words that are not as important to the language. But in my time speaking toki pona, I hardly ever see a conversation where more than one of these additional words beyond the 120 are used. To be fair, this is also the case for a set of the original 120, but the 120 are unambiguously part of almost all speakers’ vocabularies. I usually say “around 120 words” because without this nuance, any other number would be a little misleading and raise a lot of questions. 137 is a really specific number and isn’t particularly accurate. “About 200” is way too high of an estimate, because most speakers and conversations never even come close to reaching that threshold.</p>

                  <summary id="easy-to-learn">Q - If there are only around 120 words, wouldn't toki pona be really easy to learn? Could I get fluent in just a month? Two weeks? A few days? 30 hours? Three hours?</summary>
                  <p><strong>A</strong> - It’s possible to get conversational very fast. It took me about three days to get through the whole vocabulary, though it took me a couple of months to refine that, and it took me years to feel their semantic spaces like I feel English’s. If you want to learn toki pona because you think it’ll be faster than other languages, there may be some truth to that, but think about what you want to get out of learning a language. Community? Philosophy? A new outlook on life? To prove a point? To know what it’s like? Because the language you want to learn was taken from you generations ago? Because the language seems interesting? There are so many reasons to want to learn a language, and all of these reasons have motivated me to learn a language, be that Portuguese, Yiddish, or toki pona. toki pona isn’t a thing you can learn in a day, but you can still learn part of it in a day. It’s a journey, and the journey for learning toki pona is unique and unlike any other language I’ve encountered. Every bit of practice helps you learn, but all in all I wouldn’t claim proficiency for at least a month and I would be wary about claiming fluency until six months in.</p>

                  <summary id="who-made-toki-pona">Q - Who made toki pona?</summary>
                  <p><strong>A</strong> - Sonja Lang! She's a cool lady. I've met her a couple of times in person and she's always really kind and fun to spend time with. She plays chess, studies Malay, and often likes to keep to herself, though she frequents online communities and attends IRL meetups. She doesn't like it when people put her on a pedestal and she prefers to be treated like any other toki ponist. Please respect her!</p>

                  <summary id="what-is-toki-pona-for">Q - What is toki pona for?</summary>
                  <p><strong>A</strong> - Nobody except for Sonja Lang was in Sonja Lang's head from 2000 to 2001, when she was working on the language. She has gone on to say that she attempted to describe the meaning of life using a language with 120 words or fewer, but it's not clear why she wanted this or if this was her only motivation. In reality, toki pona began as a personal language for Sonja Lang and nobody else. She shared it with the world, and now, two decades later, it's a living language with lots of speakers who would all answer this question differently. So while toki pona was made with a specific purpose, its purpose now is up to its speakers, and I encourage everyone reading this to explore what toki pona is for, for themselves.</p>

                      <p><strong>English translation (by lipamanka):</strong></p>
                      <p>What does it mean to say that a language is <em>for</em> something? Languages are tools and can't want things. When people make languages, they may want the language to be for something, but when we look at a language by itself, there's no desire.</p>
                      <p>People use national or regional languages because it's everywhere. When people are in a place, they use the language associated with that place. French is the language of France. French is for the people of France to communicate.</p>
                      <p>Esperanto is different. Someone made it for something, specifically such that all people in all places can talk to everyone, bringing people together and warding off ill will. But because Zamenhof (the creator of Esperanto) gave it this purpose, other people may want to do other things with it. I believe that at the moment, the Esperanto community's desires align with Zamenhof's, but the strength of the desire has diminished. Esperantists don't want to use Esperanto to fix everything anymore, they just want to use it to make friends and feel good within the Esperanto community. Right now, Esepranto is for bringing Esperantists together.</p>
                      <p>So what is toki pona for? Just like Esperanto, the creator of toki pona made it for something, and just like Esperanto, other people may see something different in it. But just like with Esperantists, what speakers want for the language arise in the context of what the creator wanted. hm. Maybe not for all speakers, but for me, this is true. I don't know all the details of what other people think, but I can talk about what toki pona is for for me:</p>
                      <p>Look at everything in an entirely different way.</p>
                      <p>When I use toki pona, I know things in a new way, which teaches me a lot about things. Other languages can do this a little, but toki pona is the strongest because it's just so different from other languages. For example, a lot of other languages talk about abstract concepts by taking the English word for that concept and loaning it. When I've looked at a lot of languages, and the way people talk about simple concepts will diverge a lot from how English speakers do, but when things get abstract, every language just uses the English word. That's really weird! With toki pona, look at something from a new angle. Develop your own way of speaking based on only a few words. With new perspectives come new ways of knowing.</p>

                      <p>toki pona is, in my opinion, a language focused around deconstruction. what does this mean? it means that toki pona is really helpful as a tool for breaking down complex things into more manageable tiny things. its main philosophy (based around the concept of pona) is built off of this fundamental concept. toki pona is also helpful for language learners who want to start off with something easy, or people who like the idea of learning a conlang. toki pona is for whatever you'd use a regular language for too. toki pona is for any time you need to express things in a simple good way.</p>

                      <p><strong>English translation (by lipamanka):</strong></p>
                      <p>toki pona is for having fun with others. When I speak toki pona, my fears vanish along with my social anxiety. I feel great! If I make a mistake while speaking, I can fix it, and I can't do that in English.</p>
                      <p>Another thing is that with English, there are a lot of super specific words that can get pretty long. If you use a lot of big words, you make people think "Oh this guy's super smart. Hold on, they feel angry. Oh, they want to FIGHT ME!!".. but maybe not. With toki pona, words don't make people <em>feel</em> things. So you can give information without an agenda, right? A lot of the time English words have different meanings depending on who you're talking to. One person may say that a word makes them angry, but someone else might feel completely differently. But in toki pona, words don't make you seem smarter, and they don't make anyone feel bad or angry. Only when words come together to form a conversation does this happen.</p>

                      <p>i don’t like saying toki pona is “for” any one thing or any group of things, i think thats misleading</p>
                      <p>bc like you can use tp for anything, but you have to use it the right way if that makes sense</p>
                      <p>the “right way” is different from speaker to speaker, but my take is that you should Actually Describe your surroundings and be understood by the people around you (this actually entails not using many nimisin for reasons that are off topic)</p>
                      <p>keeping in touch with the wider community is also very important</p>
                      <p>but thats just how you should use tp, not what you should use it for</p>
                      <p>if someone says “toki pona isnt for talking about math”, you can safely assume they dont speak tp
                      do with this advice as you will</p>

                      <p>i think that now that toki pona has expanded into a whole speaking community and is no longer the possession of its creator (as sonja lang admitted a long time ago) there isn't really any one thing that it's "for" anymore. everyone has their own purpose for learning and using toki pona and i don't think that's a bad thing. there's definitely common ground that a lot of people would say toki pona is "for" but i don't think you could get a definition that every single speaker would agree on</p>
                      <p>aside from like. "it's simple." but thats not really a purpose just a general fact about it</p>

                      <p>i think one specific thing that toki pona lends itself to is creative expression.</p>
                      <p>a toki pona speaker has to take the basic building blocks -- a painter's brushes and paints, a composer's rhythms and pitches -- and turn them into a composition more meaningful than the sum of their parts. many times, experienced speakers will convey the exact same ideas in vastly varying and different ways -- and yet, they still will completely understand each other. and i just think that's  neat and interesting, and something you might not see in a language built on more specific words and concepts.</p>

                      <p>toki pona is for being silly and tearing down anything that prevents you being silly. by virtue of its simplicity and lack of any specific cultural bias it allows you to free yourself of the shackles imposed on you by the culture you live in. although the toki pona community itself may have a cultural bias, being primarily composed of leftist neurodivergent teenagers in my experience, i believe this is a consequence of its design. toki pona will naturally appeal to those who feel outcasted as it does not have any preconceived notions of what is "good" or "bad" besides simplicity and complexity.</p>

                      <p>Toki Pona is useful for learning how to learn languages. Before I learned Toki Pona, I had no idea how to effectively self-study a language and assumed I was bad at language learning from struggling in my lessons in school. Through learning Toki Pona, I found tools such as Memrise and I found that I like to have vocabulary memorised first before learning a grammar point.</p>
                      <p>It's a simpler version of every aspect of language learning and it's an extremely useful first language to learn for that reason. If Toki Pona did not exist, then I would not have even started to learn Lojban. It's a huge confidence booster!</p>

                  <p><strong>A</strong> - Why would anyone learn how to play a banjo recreationally? Not everything we have to do needs to be useful, so why would that be the same for language learning? Some people do it for fun. For others, the philosophy and design goals of the langauge appeal to them. I’ve even see people who claim that learning some amount of toki pona is a rite of passage in the conlanging community, though I’m not sure I’d agree. For them though, why can’t it be? The reasons for learning toki pona are as diverse as the reasons for learning anything else, with the exception of being as useful as spanish would be to an american who lives on the mexican border to the south.</p>

                  <summary id="does-anyone-speak-toki-pona">Q - Is there really anyone who speaks toki pona? And where is toki pona spoken?</summary>
                  <p><strong>A</strong> - Yes! According to census data, there were about 1,500 speakers, as of late 2022. I attended a meetup in DC where a dozen or so speakers enjoyed each other’s company and hardly spoke any English the whole time. While it may not be spoken as much as most of the natural languages people are aware of, it is still spoken.</p>
                  <p>As for where toki pona is spoken, I've met toki pona speakers from every continent except antarctica. While there are only a handful of IRL toki pona speaking communities, and those communities are very small (a dozen people at most who all live in a much larger city), some hotspots I know of are the Bay Area in California, Seattle, and the Twin Cities for some reason. But I've also been to some of these places, and I live in the Twin Cities, so it makes sense that I would know more toki ponists who live there than anywhere else. If you do some looking, you may be able to find toki ponists in your area too. I met one of my toki pona speaking friends who lives in the Twin Cities at a meetup in chicago. Outside of North America, I am sure that there are some toki pona speaking communities in Western Europe, but elsewhere I'm not sure and I can't really speculate. The more you hang out in online spaces, the more people you'll meet who live near you. But if you're not an adult yet, please be careful before planning to meet up with people you met online. It can be really fun but it can also be dangerous.</p>
                  <p>It's 100% true to say that toki pona is almost entirely spoken online, so it's not usually associated with a country, but if it were, that country would probably be Canada, the home country of Sonja Lang, I guess.</p>

                  <summary id="fluency">Q - How do I know when I'm fluent in toki pona?</summary>
                  <p>I have spoken with dozens of toki ponists about this, and the range of what "fluent" means to different people specifically in the context of toki pona varies so much that it's basically meaningless. You can go label yourself as fluent right now. Nobody will stop you. Anyone who uses the label "fluent" in a bio with a character limit is wasting six characters plus the spaces around it and punctuation if present.</p>
                  <p>For natural languages, you will similarly get variable responses about what "fluent" means, but the difference with those is that you have native proficiency to compare. Fluency is often proportional to native proficiency, either equivilent or able to communicate with a native speaker on a veriety of topics. toki pona lacks any native speakers and it's not clear at all what native proficiency would look like.</p>
                  <p>Another common definition of fluency for natural languages is the size of a speaker's vocabularly. You cannot use this metric in toki pona because it's possible to memorize all of the common words in the entire lexicon in a week without learning any of the grammar.</p>
                  <p>beginner toki pona speakers also have a habit of overestimating their toki pona skills, and this also may be true for speakers of all levels (though underestimation is also common, especially among higher proficient speakers). So if you see someone self-identify as fluent, it really doesn't mean much.</p>
                  <p>Am I fluent? If a reporter is asking me, I will say yes. If it's to get hired for something related to toki pona, I will say yes. But using the word "fluent" in a social setting for toki pona seems gross to me. It implies that my opinions are more valuable than those of nonfluent speakers. I am upfront about my experience with toki pona, but I do not actually identify under the label "fluent."</p>

              <summary id="real">Q - Is toki pona a real language?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Yes! In fact, from almost all definitions of a language, toki pona qualifies. Unless you also don’t consider Esperanto and Dothraki languages, the constructed nature of toki pona doesn’t prevent it from being a language. And, unless you don’t consider Ancient Egyptian and Medieval Galician to be languages, toki pona’s lack of native speakers doesn’t prevent it from being a language. (linguistics jargon ahead!!) toki pona fits each and every one of Hockett’s design features of langauge, which linguists around the world use as a basis for the defintion of language. The small vocabulary, while unique, doesn’t prevent it from communicating anything that a communication system needs in order to be considered a language. Even though it has recursion via some analyses, that doesn’t really matter. Despite <em>some linguists</em> beleiving that all language needs embedded recursion, toki pona is able to use solely anaphora to acomplish the same thing, which if anything suggests that the theory of universal grammar needs a rework. toki pona is not a natural language, but it is still a language, and it’s real.</p>
              <p>toki pona also has an ISO code, which means it is OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED by the International Organization for Standardization as a <em>real language.</em> Take that, HATERS!!</p>

This is one of the few places I put the word "fluent" next to "toki pona." toki pona proficiency is something im proud of, and I have been hired three times with toki pona on my resume. Sometimes hierers just want to see that you're multilingual, and the exact nature of the second language may matter less than having one at all. Though I can understand why Spanish may be more advantagious if you were applying for a job in Southern Texas.</p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - Nope! It does get harder though. Do not base the capabilities of toki pona on your own abilities a week in. If you can’t think of a way to say something, that doesn’t mean there isn’t one. Proficiency isn’t knowing a lot of words—it’s being able to describe a large range of concepts, and that can take months. I learned what a derivative was in toki pona. I’ve witnessed people criticize code written on a walk using only toki pona. Often people will use jargon as a gotcha—-can’t describe a higgs boson in toki pona! And while I probably couldn’t do it justice, I’m sure there is a quantum physisit out there who is able to describe it properly. You just gotta know what something is from the ground up. Describing something complex is easy if you turn it into a lot of simple things.</p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - You're right, actually. toki pona hasn't been around for a very long time, and the speakers of toki pona are not professional doctors who spent years learning how to do their job in toki pona. Doctors usually learn how to do what they do while communicating in a specific language. They train for at least a decade usually before they start working. Being a doctor doesn't just require proficiency in a language and a separate proficiency in doctoring. It requires a mixture of both in which a doctor is capable of doctoring in a specific language. If a doctor spent a decade studying toki pona doctoring, they could probably do it pretty well, but there aren't centuries of resources on doctoring in toki pona, and the way toki pona would talk about the human body would differ a lot from the majority of languages that doctoring is done it, so it would take significant effort. So yes, toki pona doesn't work in a doctor's office, but that doesn't mean it never could, just that it doesn't now and it probably never will. Please visit a doctor who speaks whatever language you are most proficient in.</p>

              <summary id="newspeak">Q - This reminds me of Newspeak from 1984 by George Orwell. Does toki pona limit what you can think about like Newspeak does?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - I personally haven't read the whole book, but I understand what newspeak is, and its goals are completely different from toki pona's. Newspeak was designed to opress by limiting what people are able to think about. This is actually impossible to do anyway, because language cannot limit what you are able to think about. It can only influence what you do end up thinking about. For example, the words you use when talking to someone in Korean change depending on their age, marital status, and other factors, so a Korean speaker will probably remember if you're married better than an english speaker (unless the english speaker needs to call you "Ms." vs "Mrs.") That doesn't mean that English speakers aren't able to think or talk about marriage. Quite the contrary! Some Anglophones won't shut up about it. And that's beautiful.</p>
              <p>toki pona, on the other hand, was designed for fun and exploration! Thinking in toki pona doesn't limit what I'm able to think about. It may limit what you can think about while you're still learning, but that's hardly unique to toki pona. When I think in tok pisin, I can't think about complicated linguistics terms or plant taxonomy. But that's an issue of proficiency, not of the language itself.</p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - Once again, not a question. But why is this true? Pirahã doesn't have a robust number system beyond words for "a few" and "a lot." Lots of natural languages avoid precise numbers for things above a certain threshold. I talk more about how the lack of a robust number system factors into the philosophy of toki pona <a href="#numbers-philosophy">here</a> if you're curious. But the most convincing reasoning is that in no defenition of a language is a number system mentioned. For example, hockett's design features doesn't include anything about numbers. Not even Noam Chomsky <!--(peace be upon him)--> mentions number systems as a factor into what is and isn't a language. This proposed universal, "all full languages have number systems," is not suggested anywhere in linguistics.</p>

              <summary id="esperanto">Q - Esperanto does a much better job than toki pona does.</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - This isn't a question, but Sonja Lang and I worked on an answer together. Sonja Lang speaks Esperanto and has been an Esperantist for longer than toki pona has existed, so it may be natural to think that Sonja's conlang was created to build upon and improve Esperanto.</p>
              <p>But it's important to understand that toki pona is trying to acieve something completely different. Esperanto was created to be an International Auxiliary Language, meant to facilitate communication across different native languages on a global scale. On the other hand, toki pona was designed as a minimalist language with a focus on simplicity and philosophical reflection.</p>
              <p>Today, toki pona has grown beyond its original design and is used by a small global community, functioning as a "small world language." However, its purpose remains distinct from that of Esperanto. While Esperanto aims for widespread international communication, toki pona emphasizes a personal relationship with language and the distillation of complex ideas into basic concepts.</p>
              <p>You don't have to like toki pona—it's a language with a specific purpose, and it might not appeal to everyone. If it doesn't resonate with you, that's completely fine! There are many other constructed languages out there, and you might find one that suits your interests better, or you could even try creating your own. Every constructed language has its unique purpose and audience. Natural languages are fun too.</p>

The range of ideas they can refer to, also known as their “semantic space,” is usually a really big set of objects with a few shared traits, just like in other languages. The big difference in toki pona is that those ranges are much bigger. It’s not like each toki pona word has eighteen different seperate meanings. toki pona isn’t like the golden compass from His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman.</p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - This is a pretty common misconception that may be slightly harmful. There is no evidence that toki pona has a positive effect on depression or any other mental illness. Annecdotally, many people have shared that the community helped them with real human connection. Dispite speculation, toki pona has never served sucessfully as an assisted communication tool for mute and nonverbal people. This doesn't mean that toki pona for sure <em>doesn't</em> do any of these things, but there's no reason why it would be uniquely equipped when compared with other hobbies that can bring community to someone. This should go without saying but please seek professional help if you are struggling with depression. toki pona is absolutely not a replacement for modern medicine and should never be treated as such.</p>

              <summary id="compounds">Q - If words are often compounded, doesn’t that mean the compounds become new words, and the language has far more than just 120 words?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - If that happened, then yes. Because toki pona is built upon a small vocabulary, speakers want it to stay that way, and avoid creating compounds like this. You can still modify one word with another, but as soon as there’s extra meaning not given by the two words alone or context, it’s become lexicalized. Despite the effort of speakers, this can happen sometimes. Fortunately, it’s pretty rare, and most speakers avoid it. So toki pona still has about 120 words.</p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - Okay let me work quickly here. Calling some cultures simpler than others, no matter the context, is racist. It has been used to justify colonialism. “Look at these simple people! We need to take control of them and their land so we can bring them the joys of Complex European Culture.” If you think this is overly dramatic, it’s not. These are real justifications used by real people, and they are used today. Now that that’s out of the way, similarly to how it’s difficult to put all people on a single sliding scale of general intelligence, it’s very difficult to put all languages on a sliding scale of general complexity. It is possible to compare aspects of languages. For example, toki pona has a less complex inflectional morphology system than English. toki pona has a much smaller lexicon than Vietnamese. toki pona requires more information to be disambiguated via context in order to disambiguate large concepts than Nahuatl. But to say toki pona is <em>generally</em> simpler than other langauges is misguided and not really useful.</p>

This wouldn’t be possible if it was a simple cipher. A toki pona speaker cannot rely on english when speaking toki pona.</p>

              <p>What sounds culty about it? This isn't a funny term to be thrown around. There are many people who have suffered (and are currently suffering) through cult abuse, and it's frankly disheartening how much the term is thrown around and used as a punchline. It's become a buzzword. If you have concerns about toki pona being a cult, let me know on discord and I promise I'll get back to you.</p>

              <summary id="native">Q - I heard that there were some native toki pona speakers. Is this true?</summary>
              <p>BEFORE I write ANYTHING ELSE I want to make clear that the answer is NO at the time being. There are in fact NO native speakers and the guy who said that he was raising native speakers in a youtube video was LYING. You can learn more about this <a href="https://lukapona.blogspot.com/2023/02/native-speakers-pi-toki-ponali-lon-ala.html">here</a>. (It's a great read by jan Olipija.)</p>
              <p>Something that Olipija doesn't mention is the use of the word "native." This word can be kind of problematic for a few reasons. I'll list them here.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The indigenous people of the Americas, also known as Native Americans, are "native." Wether or not they speak their indigenous language from childhood or not, an indigenous person's language is still a Native language, and it's their Native language, by virtue of the word "Native." All speakers of indigenous languages in the Americas are Native speakers, and all people indigenous to the americas are Native speakers because they are speakers that are Native. So while this doesn't say much about toki pona, the term itself is not universally applicable to all languages because of this confusion. Many people prefer "mother language," "first language," "language from childhood," or "L1." From here on I'm going to put "native" in quotes to highlight this, but I'm going to continue using that term.</li>
                <li>The concept of who is and isn't a "native" speaker is kind of a loaded subject a lot of the time. The people who have the privilege of deciding the criteria for this are usually those in power. The exact definition of "native" speaker can range from learning a language anywhere between the ages of 0 and 14, depending on who you ask. So the answer to this question may be yes! There are many people who learned toki pona below the age of 14. But that's a pretty high estimate. A more reasonable estimate of the critical age where the brain stops learning languages as quickly is 7.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It's very possible that we will eventually have "native" speakers. But we should absolutely not treat them as divine. They will just be Guys. Let us treat them as Guys. Like please if we ever have "native" speakers please be normal about it like please.</p>

                <summary id="native-speakers-ethical">Q - Is it ETHICAL to raise "native" toki pona speakers?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - Yes! It's as ethical is it is to raise "native" speakers of any other language. However, it is not ethical to raise them as <em>monolingual</em> toki pona speakers. That would be an example of language deprevation, which is when the guardians of a child cut off the ability for a child to communicate with people besdies themselves, in this case through restricting linguistic capabilities severely to a somewhat obscure constructed language that is not used for any legal documents that the child would need to be able to read -OR- for systems of education available to the child. This is child abuse! Do not do this!</p>
                <p>Babies are magical little things. There is no upper bound on the amount of languages a child can speak "natively" (though in some cases it may be more effort on the parents. Like there's a reason why my mom didn't raise me fluent in Italian. I was a small ball of ADHD that needed full time attention and moderate support needs. There was simply Too Much to be keeping track of. I also had a twin sister with other mental things so it was A Lot and I don't blame her.). So teaching a baby toki pona in addition to any other languages they may be learning can work.</p>

                  <summary id="should-i-raise-native-toki-pona-speakers">Q - Should I raise "native" toki pona speakers?</summary>
                  <p><strong>A</strong> - It's definitely worth trying, no matter how old they are. If they're still before the critical age, there are some things to keep in mind and some tips to take to heart. Here is <strong>How to raise a "native" toki pona speaker:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Talk TO them!</strong> Children will only aquire a language if there is two way interaction with them in that language, so you'd need to talk to them as well. Do whatever you'd do with a different language but with toki pona as you'd normally speak it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't be their only toki pona interaction!</strong> The group of children that a child spends time with during development has a huge impact on the way they speak. For many children (but not all), if their only input for a language is a parent, they will stop speaking the language as soon as they start going to school (and no, this is not a good reason to isolate your child. Like Please Do Not Do That.). You will have the most success if you can find other toki pona speakers in your area to interact with them, and especially if they also have kids that are being raised as toki pona speakers (which is extremely unlikely).</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't worry about slower development with other languages!</strong> toki pona has only 120 words. Children are able to separate grammar between languages really easily, but a baby learning two languages will learn the same amount of words on average as a baby learning just one language, split up between the languages. Eventually their vocabulary in both languages will get very high given they get enough exposure to both and not just one, but it will appear that the child is aquiring language slower. However, with toki pona, there is no reason to believe that this will be the case. Because aquisition of grammatical structures is incredibly fast and strong, toki pona shouldn't take up that much of the child's total lexicon. toki pona relies on grammar and context much more than lexicon to convey information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discourage lexicalization</strong> and your kids will pick up on toki pona's lack of lexicalized compounds. In fact, lexicalizing compounds will negate the benefits of the previous point (just like lexicalizing compounds negates all benefits of a small vocabulary; this is one of those benefits). Children should be able to figure out easily that the first word in a phrase is what the thing is (like "kili loje" is a type of "kili"), and children will be able to figure out that no matter the object of a verb, the verb doesn't change in meaning outside of context. Make sure to freshen it up here and there with new ways of talking about things! Of coruse, don't let this stop you from having fun little things you call things. But try to shake it up. This goes for phatic phrases too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nobody has succeeded here yet.</strong> At the time of writing (August 2024), there have been no successful attempts to raise "native" toki pona speakers. So all of this is speculation (based on my somewhat extensive knowledge of language aquisition). So if something I say doesn't seem to be true with your kid, throw it out the window! And also let me know! I would be very curious! (Except for the lexicalization tip. PLEASE discourage lexicalized compounds. I promise you that your child can learn how to talk about things without creating new lexicalized compounds.)</li>

              <summary id="IAL">Q - Is toki pona meant for everyone in the world to learn it easily, like Esperanto? or: Is toki pona an IAL (international auxiliary language)?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Not quite. Unlike Esperanto, toki pona wasn’t designed explicitly for this purpose. However, part of its design was to be culturally neutral towards natural langauges across the world, something that Esperanto doesn’t really succeed at. toki pona lacks sounds that aren’t abundantly common in natural languages. It lacks complicated cultural customs that exist in any culture associated with natural languages. Its words come from a very interesting set of languages, which do include European languages, but also include languages from outside of Europe. A lot of the vocabulary is recognizable to English speakers. But hypothetically, if given access to the same resources, the advantage being a native English speaker affords is marginal at best and wouldn’t help much. So while toki pona was made primarily for other things, this is something it is good at.</p>

              <summary id="vague">Q - How do I know what people are talking about if the words are so vague?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - The answer here is a bit complicated and goes into the heart of toki pona’s philosophy. In most languages, there are two methods people use to disambiguate. The first is a large lexicon with lots of words that can mean lots of specific things. English has the word “phonebook” which is very specific. However, you could also use the other method—context—to describe the same thing using only words that are as vague as toki pona words, or close anyway. “A large book filled with numbers. Some of the pages are white, and some of them are yellow. I can use these numbers on the white pages to communicate with other people even when I’m not in the same room using a different tool, the telephone. I can use the numbers on the yellow pages to contact buisnesses.” I’m not sure if everyone reading this knows what a phonebook is, but one thing to note is that if the listener does know what one is, they could probably cut off the speaker at the end of the second sentence. It doesn’t really take that long after all. And if someone doesn’t know what a phonebook is, they’d probably need it to be explained to them anyway. toki pona has a small lexicon to force its speakers to communicate using the second method only—no large lexicon with lots of words that can mean specific things means that speakers have to use context to be understood, which might feel a little weird. It’s one of the reasons why toki pona can take a while to get the hang of, which is unique. This process can slow down how you think and help you analyze what actually needs to be communicated using words in order to get across what you want to get across. It’s not as efficient as natural languages are, but it’s not that much less efficient either.</p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - Of course! Because the language varies so much by speaker, the exact way this manifests can change from person to person, and there have been no studies on this, so I don't have any more specific data for toki pona as a whole. As for myself, I tend to be more verbose when speaking out loud.</p>

Especially when there are people online ready to answer all your questions with reliable answers for free, why would you need to use AI? I've seen some people on the subreddit post responses based on AI and said "this is what the AI said," and they're always either at least half gibberish or false/misleading. Join kama sona, a discord server for toki pona learners, or post on the subreddit if you want these questions answered. And chances are they will get answered like immediately.</p>

I am not very proud of my first translations, but I'm VERY proud that I tried. Don't get too attached to your early translations and don't be afraid to scrap them. They will probably be very bad, so think of them as a learning tool and not a final product you can publish that others will enjoy profusely. Good luck!</p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - DEFINITELY learn them at the same time! Especially if you're dyslexic like me, being a proficient reader of a logography will be a big confidence boost early on. There is significant scientific evidence that dyslexic people read faster when reading logographies than when reading alphabets. Most proficient speakers I know read sitelen pona, and sitelen pona is really fun and cool! Make sure to experiment with sitelen pona. When I learned toki pona, I actually learned the glyphs and their meanings before learning the words themselves. I think this was particularly useful for me because I could tie the semantic spaces to glyphs before having to tie them to sounds, which made reading them faster.</p>

              <summary id="simplify-thoughts">Q - Will Toki Pona really teach me to simplify my thoughts?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - It might! One of the goals of toki pona is to slow down thinking so you can be aware of what you're really thinking about. Like the classic example of a bad friend. If a friend is a jan pona, then a bad friend is a jan pona ike, which doesn't make sense. So maybe a friend isn't always a jan pona. You HAVE to think about these things in order to communicate effectively in toki pona. Is this method of thinking really more simple than how you normally think? In my opinion, it's just different, not more simple. But who knows!</p>

              <summary id="help-learn-other-language">Q - Will Toki Pona help me learn a different language?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - There is actually a study on this! Paolo Coluzzi, an Italian professor at Universiti Malaya, conducted a study entitled <em>How learning Toki Pona may help improving communication strategies in a foreign or second language.</em> In it, he has his Italian students try to use circumlocution (talking around things) before and after four toki pona classes. My italian isn't great, but it looks like any effect toki pona had on learning Italian was concentrated specifically in circumlocution. For example, a student who translated "monkeys" as "monkeys" (which is, unsuprisingly, not actually an Italian word) translated it as "molti animali che gli piace mangiare la banana" (which means "many animals that like to eat the banana") after the four lessons. Students were also more likely to use less specific terms when they didn't know the Italian word for something. For example, one student who translated "cherries" as "fragole" (which means "strawberries") and another student who translated it as "ceri" (which is a phonetic transcription in Italian of the English word "cherry" that is plural because it ends in an i) both later translated it as "frute" (which means "fruits"). Circumlocution is an important skill in language learning, and the evidence from this study looks somewhat promising, but it had a sample size of six, which is definitely not many! So we don't really know, but a lot of toki pona speakers have claimed that it has helped them, and I can agree that anecdotally learning toki pona has helped me with circumlocution in my target languages. This is all to say: <strong>we don't know for sure, but anecdotally, some toki pona speakers attribute ease of language aquisition of other languages to having learned toki pona in some aspects.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - Well, there might be a single word for it! For example, the toki pona word for "defenestrate" is "pana." The toki pona word for "antidisestablishmentarianism" is "nasin." The word for "Eukaryota Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Procyon Lotor" is "soweli" (or in this case, you could also use kijetesantakalu). None of these words are very specific, and definitely not as specific as their english counterparts, but it's really not that hard to elaborate on what makes antidisestablishmentarianism different from other nasin, or that which separates Eukaryota Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Procyon Lotor from other soweli. Sometimes, though, those details aren't relevant to communicate an idea, so toki ponists leave them out!</p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - tokiponidos are conlangs based off of toki pona. Sometimes a learner or speaker of toki pona will want to tweak the design goals of toki pona, and frequently they'll design a new language that answers the question, "what if toki pona did X instead of Y?" For example, tuki tiki answers "what if toki pona only had 39 words?" luka pona sign language answers "what if toki pona was a signed language?" There aren't really any other notable tokiponidos besides these two, but if you disagree with any of the design choices Sonja Lang made or any of the common ways toki pona is used, consider trying to branch out to tokiponidos. You might enjoy yourself more!</p>

              <summary id="numbers-philosophy">Q - Why doesn't toki pona have a more robust number system?</summary>
              <p>Specific numbers are complicated and often not as necessary in our lives as we think they are. A good toki ponist will avoid talking about the specific numbers of things when possible. toki pona is built perfectly for cooking, not baking. In home cooking, you never give an exact weight of garlic to use in a dish, you just use however much feels right. You learn how to get a feel for these things through experience and through learning from others, which is how knowledge of cooking has been passed down around the world for thousands of years.</p>
              <p>Dates are often not very important if you live your live spontaniously, which toki pona's lack of numbers encourages. If you live close to other toki pona speakers, you can text them day of and as "are you doing anything today?" and if they're not, you can meet up right away! This is unfortunately not compatable with a society in which we are forced to work long jobs far away from our homes and pay large sums of money on rent, which limits our ability to live near people we want to live near. Sometimes we need to plan things in advance anyway. This does go against toki pona's philosophy of dates, unfortunately.</p>
              <p>Specific distances and durations are not as important as you think. Sometimes the experience of going a certain distance itself is enough, and the exact number isn't important. toki pona encourages its speakers to pay attention to these things and have a sense for their enviornments. How long it takes to get to a place should come from the experience of going there many times, not from google maps. Unfortunately, once again, many societies are not built for this. Most cities in the united states are so relient on either cars or public transportation that even though everything's so close together, there are so many things that you visit new locations every day. Maybe getting a sense for how long it takes to get to work is easy, but if you're hungry for Thai food and you want to go to a place you've never been before, having a number on how long it takes to get there is really useful in the moment. toki pona would prefer that you tried making thai food at home <a href="https://lipamanka.gay/essays/food">without measurements</a>.</p>
              <p>All this aside, there are actually a few systems that are both used and understood frequently in the case that you really do need to use numbers. You can learn more <a href="https://lipamanka.gay/essays/FAQ#numbers">here</a>.</p>

It's called <em>luka pona sign language</em> and you can learn more about it on <a href="https://lukapona.blogspot.com/">jan Olipija</a>'s blog, which includes lessons and a bunch of unrelated articles that are all good reads. There is also a version of exact signed toki pona present in lipu pu, but it is not an actual sign language, it's just a cypher of toki pona. Specific luka pona Q&A:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Q - Do you have to be proficient in toki pona in order to learn luka pona?</strong> A - I guess you don't, but all of the resources on luka pona are in toki pona, and all of the teaching I've seen for luka pona has been done in toki pona. Actually, it's mostly done <em>in</em> luka pona. It is against the rules to learn luka pona while using spoken language. Written language is fine, but because of systemic issues around the formation of sign language communities and how tied together with Deaf culture sign languages can be, teaching a sign language in a way that is inaccessible to deaf or hard of hearing people is considered disrespectful to deaf people, hard of hearing people, and Deaf culture. knowledge of toki pona also really helps you learn luka pona, so don't start with luka pona unless you already have knowledge of a specific sign language and can learn in that instead. Learning about how sign languages work AND learning one that accompanies a language you've never spoken before is really hard.</li>
                <li><strong>Q - If you already speak toki pona, how long does it take to learn luka pona?</strong> A - It really depends on the person. People who struggle with proprioception may struggle more with learning luka pona, for example. But the bottom line is that if you've never used a sign language before, luka pona will be significantly difficult.</li>
                <li><strong>Q - Where can I learn luka pona?</strong> A - There are lessons on the discord server kama sona! You can find it on Sonja Lang's website, and I recommend it most to beginners of both toki pona and luka pona. You can also use the blog post I linked above.</li>
                <li><strong>Q - What's the difference between a sign language and a spoken language?</strong> A - I am not qualified to answer this, but I can at least tell you that grammatically, there are a LOT of things that they don't share in common.</li>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - This is a really good question, and it can depend on your spirituality. toki pona can work as well as any language, but I've found that it can work <em>better</em> because the individual words are such powerful symbols that spirits and the like can latch onto them really easily. So it's easier to transmit intent. But as long as your intent is clear your occultism and divining should work no matter the language. Unless you like don't speak said language and then prolly not. As with all things spiritual, try stuff out and see what works.</p>

              <summary id="">Q - What are the official toki pona books?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Sonja Lang has published three toki pona books herself through her own publishing company, Tawhid Press. According to her, these books are the only "official" things about toki pona, and they are still not to be treated as special and any more correct than any other resource on the language (much like how the word of Sonja Lang isn't automatically correct). These books are, in order of publishing:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Toki Pona: the Language of Good</strong> - A set of extremely well crafted toki pona lessons from 2014, epresentitive of Sonja Lang's usage of toki pona at the time. It is xtremely influetial. In toki pona, the word "pu" means "to interact with Toki Pona: the Language of Good." In english, the word "pu" is often used to refer to the book directly, something that is uncommon in toki pona.</li>
                <li><strong>Toki Pona Dictionary</strong> - A collection of example translations between toki pona and English, using data complied on the discord server <em>ma pona pi toki pona</em> in 2020-2021. Like pu, this book also has a toki pona word: "ku." This word is used exactly like the word "pu" in both languages.</li>
                <li><strong>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Toki Pona edition)</strong> - Sonja Lang's translation of <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.</em> She chose this book because it is public domain. Just like the other two official books, it too has a special word that works the same way the others do: "su." However, "su" will potentially refer to other official translations of public domain books by Sonja Lang.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Besides these three books and <a href="https://tokipona.org">tokipona.org</a>, nothing related to toki pona is "official," according to Sonja.</p>

              <details>
                <summary id="">Q - What order should I buy the official toki pona books in?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - Definitely buy pu first. I still use my copy a lot after owning it for almost seven years. It's the most influential of the books and the most useful. The dictionary in the back, while free online, is still one of the most useful things in the history of the language because it lists the parts of speech which can be very important for deriving meanings and figuring out what toki pona was like when sonja wrote it. It's also the book that various <a href="#jan-lupa">people</a> who don't engage with online communities learn from, so learning how pu describes toki pona can help you communicate with these people (who do exist!! I know one!!!)</p>
                <p><em>more coming soon</em></p>
                <!--
                - ku is a snapshot of examples of ways to say things, which can be useful but not for very long. It is also the most expensive.
                - su is a fiction book! you can find plenty of content for toki pona online, including stuff written in sitelen pona, and the quality of su is not uniquely well written, though it is certainly well written. the illustrations are great though.
                - I still use pu and I have had it for over six years. it is extremely important to the development of the language and it works great as a reference for when you want to discuss grammar with other toki ponists (which is something you should get used to lol). The dictionary in the back, while free online, is still one of the most useful things in the history of the language because it lists the parts of speech which can be very important for deriving meanings and figuring out what toki pona was like when sonja wrote it.

            <summary id="li-mi-sina">Q - Why can't I use "li" when the subject is "mi" or "sina"?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - The way toki pona uses "li" is very similar to how Tok Pisin, the language that the word "li" comes from, uses "i" (which is the word that li comes from). All of tok pisin's first person and second person pronouns don't need an i, and all of toki pona's first person and second person pronouns don't need a li. It's not weird crosslinguistically to use a particle like li in this way, even if it might not make sense from a logical perspective. toki pona isn't that logical in design!</p>

            <summary id="pi-nesting">Q - Can I stack/nest pi?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - When people ask this, what they mean is: is it grammatical to use pi multiple times in the same section of a sentence? And the answer is, yes! For example, "jan pi pana sona pi toki pona" could mean "person of the giving knowledge of toki pona" - toki pona teacher! The follow up question is usually, "how do I know what the second pi is modifying? Is it modifying the first pi phrase, or the original word?" And the answer to that is that usually it's clear from context, and there's no way to know if it's one or the other based on the grammar alone.</p>
            <p>It is also true that most toki pona speakers do this very rarely if at all. At the point you want to make a noun long enough to have two pi phrases in it, you should probably separate that information into a new sentence. It's often easy to misunderstand a stacked or nested pi, so a lot of speakers discourage usage in learners. I personally think that every learner can improve their toki pona by trying to communicate without using pi at all for a little while. I have known toki pona speakers who have gone years without using it, much less stacking it or nesting it.</p>

            <summary id="context">Q - People keep telling me that "context matters." What does that mean?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - The context provided for a sentence is all of the information the receiver of language has access to. There are lots of types of context, but the big ones I've noticed that come up for toki pona are presupposition, situational context, prior knowledge, and other sentences.</p>
            <p>Presuppositions are pieces of information implied by a sentence. For example, I could say "my mother gave birth yesterday!" I'm in my early 20s. First, you can presuppose that I have a mother, that I am in contact with her, and that my mom has been pregnent for the past ~9 months. But you can go deeper. If you have prior knowledge about menopause, you'll know that around a certain age, the uterus is no longer able to harbor children and the overies stop producing. That age is somewhere in the 40s age range. If I'm in my early 20s and my mother was able to give birth yesterday, you can presuppose that she probably gave birth to me when she was in her early twenties, and she is now in her 40s. It's unlikely that she gave birth before she was in her 20s. From that one sentence alone, there is so much information you can logic out. But at a certain point, it becomes speculation. Did she give birth to twins? As people get closer to menopause, they start to release more eggs at a time, making the likelyhood of giving birth to twins higher. That's not a presupposition, that's a speculation. An example of presupposition in toki pona is me saying "jan Aka li toki tawa soweli suwi ona." We can presuppose from this sentence that jan Aka li jo e soweli, and that soweli pi jan Aka li suwi.</p>
            <p>Situational context is all the things, physical or otherwise, that surround a sentence. If I say "ko suwi sina li pona seme?" That could mean a lot of things. But if you're eating ice cream, I'm almost definitely asking about the ice cream and not some other ko suwi. Because sentences have a range of possible meanings, it's important to pay attention to visual, auditory, or other clues from your surroundings. Where are you? Who are you talking to? What words did they say that represent things you can point to? All speakers of all languages end up gesturing towards things they talk about a lot too to make this context abundantly clear. If you're speaking online, this context may not be as accessible, but just the person you're talking to could be information enough. If you don't have any situational context to draw on, though, don't worry! There's plenty of context to go around!</p>
            <p>Prior knowledge is the wealth of information we hold in our minds. It's all of our past experiences, fun facts, skills, and expertese. Often toki pona speakers will learn about what each other know about, and use that as a basis to communicate. If I know that one of my friends has a background in linguistics, I can be more conservative with my description of linguistic concepts because I know at a certain point they'll get what I'm talking about. In English, this manafests as "do you know about ambiguity tests?" But because in toki pona there's no word for these jargon concepts, checking to see what prior knowledge someone has can take a while. Learning how to do this is necessary in order to move on to more advanced conversation topics in toki pona.</p>
            <p>When a speaker doesn't have enough context from the above three types of context, their main tool is to make their own! That's where other sentences come in. If information isn't clear and something in one sentence doesn't make sense, supplement that with another sentence! Let different sentences support each other. The juxtoposition of "My mom just got home!" and "My mom has been at the hospital for a month" leads to far more presuppositions, and therefore more understanding of the meaning. If someone doesn't have all the context, you can just give it to them!</p>

            <summary id="la-nesting">Q - Can I use la multiple times in one sentence? How does that work?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - I recommend using la a lot! You can use it as many times as you want in a row. But I think that thinking about it as all one big sentence can be a bit misleading. When a noun phrase comes before la (such as "tenpo pini la mi moku e pan"), that is one sentence. Stacking these is really easy: "lon la tenpo pini la tomo sina la mi moku e pan." But if an entire sentence comes before it (such as "jan li pona tawa mi la mi pona sama tawa ona"), it's better to think about it as too sentences, with the la showing cause and effect. You can string as many of these together. Don't overthink which la gets embedded inside which sentence like russian dolls. Think of it like a line of dominoes falling down one after another. And you can combine these too! Just remember: if it's a noun phrase, it's part of the sentence that follows it, and if it's an entire sentence, it's like dominoes. People use la like this all the time.</p>
            <p>Two people may sometimes both contribute to a statement, where the first one will say a sentence, and the second one will start their sentence with "la" to evoke cause and effect. Cause and effect is the name of the game with la when it's in between two sentences. It's less common to see la used this way in writing, but you will still see it here and there.</p>

            <summary id="polar-questions">Q - Is there a difference between yes/no questions marked with "anu seme" and yes/no questions marked with "X ala X"?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - When it comes to meaning, nope! They do the exact same thing. The only difference is when you can use them. Most speakers only use X ala X in sentences either with a preposition, a preverb, or a predicate that is only one word lon. Some people deviate and use X ala X on either the entire verb phrase or just the first word, but it can be hard to parse and I don't recommend that usage. "anu seme" can be appended to <em>any</em> non-question sentence to make it into a yes/no question without fail.</p>

For example: "mi kama wile awen sona pali e tomo - I've started to want to keep knowing how to build a house." or, "mi alasa sona kama wile olin sin - I'm trying to learn how to love again."</p>

            <summary id="passives">Q - Does toki pona have passive voice?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - Nope! Instead of changing "John made the pot" into "the pot was made" as most languages do*, toki pona requires you either think about what makes the pot, or just say that <em>something</em> made the pot ("ijo li pali e poki").</p>
            <p>*It is worth noting that ergative absolutive languages generally have something called an <em>antipassive</em> instead, which is not only similar but also completely different in function. toki pona doesn't have a version of this either. Nearly all natural languages have at least one of these two grammatical features, so toki pona lacking both makes it unique.</p>

            <p><strong>A</strong> - This is another situation in which toki pona asks you to rethink what the meaning is of what you're trying to say. What does it mean to make someone or something do or be something? Do you tell someone to throw a ball? Do you grab their hands and move them around? Do you cast a mind control spell? If you make a ball be red, are you painting it? Is there a button that turns on red LEDs inside the ball? What's actually happening here? Describe it! The answer here is always going to be rethinking what is going on and describing that instead.</p>

            <summary id="applicatives">Q - How does modifying verbs/predicates work?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - Modifying verbs/predicates is one of my favorite things to do in toki pona. Here are some examples that are exhaustive of the kinds of ways this can work:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"mi pana poki e telo tawa jan lili" - I feed the baby with a bottle</li> <!--verb noun applicative, which is usually instrumental I think?-->
              <li>"mi moku wawa e pan" - I eat the bread vigerously</li> <!--verb adjective applicative, i.e. adverb-->
              <li>"mi laso kasi e sike" - I paint the ball with a planty green; I paint the ball using a plant</li> <!--adjective noun applicative, which can be instrumental or otherwise-->
              <li>"mi wawa utala e sina" - I violently make you stronger</li><!--adjective verb applicative, which only works if the nominalization of the verb is tangible enough, i.e. if the adjective can be modified by the verb elsewhere-->
              <li>"mi tomo suli e sina" - I give you a large house</li> <!--noun adjective applicative-->
              <li>"mi supa olin e sina" - I tuck you into the bed of love</li><!--noun verb applicative, which works because nouns get modified with verbs a lot-->
              <li>"mi utala moku e sina" - I have a food fight with you</li><!--verb verb applicative, which only works if the nominalization of the verb is tangible enough, i.e. if the verb can be modified by the other verb elsewhere-->
              <li>"mi lete sin e sina" - I make you cold again</li> <!--adjective adjective applicative-->
              <li>"mi selo akesi e sina" - I wrap you in allegator skin clothing</li> <!--noun noun applicative-->
            </ul>
            <p>There is a lot of nitty gritty linguistics about exactly what is going on here semantically, lexically, and grammatically, but it's most important to know that you can use any word as a modifier for a predicate, and that sometimes it won't make sense without context. Like "mi loje pana e sina" is really hard to wrap my head around. Please use these examples as inspiration to play around with more ways of doing this.</p>

          <details open>
            <summary id="comparatives">Q - How do I compare things in toki pona?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - There are two types of comparisons: ones in which the compared objects are either similar or not, and ones in which some quality of them is not proportional.</p>
            <p>toki pona is way better at doing the first kind of comparisons, and it uses "sama" as a preposition to do it. For example, "soweli li sama kasi" is comparing animals to plants and saying that they're similar in some way. We can also negate sama easily: "mi sama ala jan ante" - I'm not like other girls.</p>
            <p>The second kind of comparisons is difficult. How do you say that something is better? You can easily say something like "pona kili li sama ala pona pan" - the goodness of fruits and vegetables is different from the goodness of grain products. But that doesn't specify which is better. One common way of getting around this is to juxtapose two sentences: "kili li pona. pan li ike." - fruits and veggies are good, and grain products are bad. "fruits and veggies are better than grain products." This one has the benefit of being really simple and easy to conceptualize.</p>
            <p>Another way to compare things like this is to use "tawa" (or "la") to talk about perspective and say that from the perspective of thing number one, thing number two has some quality. "sitelen sina la sitelen mi li loje." - from the perspective of your painting, mine is red. "my painting is redder than yours." You could modify the "loje" with "mute" here and it could work even better, especially if both paintings have some red on them. "mi suli tawa sina" - I'm tall, to you. "I'm taller than you." While being harder to conceptualize than the above method, this method has the benefit of being clear about the relationship between the two objects.</p>
          </details>
          <br>

          <details open>
            <summary id="articles">Q - How do I distinguish between "the" and "a"?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - I think it's worth noting here that all languages that have articles ("the" and "a" and "an" are all articles) use them completely differently. Some languages don't have any articles! So no matter what language you're learning, you will need to ask this question.</p>
            <p>Next, I encourage you to think about what the difference between "the" and "a" is in english. Try to articulate it before reading further. Or don't. Anyway, when I try to figure out the difference between these two, I think of something along the lines of: "a, which is the indefinite article, is hypothetical, and the, which is the definite article, is not hypothetical." So if the main difference is hypotheticality, then we must figure out how toki pona deals with hypotheticals.</p>
            <p>The short answer is, it doesn't, really. It's usually clear from context wether or not something is hypothetical or not. If you're talking about a specific kasi and you say "kasi," it's probably not hypothetical, but if you weren't talking about any kasi and you say "kasi," it's probably hypothetical. But if you want to specify, you can use "ni" to mean "this." As for "a(n)," if I need to clarify I will ask someone to imagine what I'm talking about in my head ("o lukin insa e ni"). I might say that it "can" happen (ken). But usually, the hypotheticality of a situation is abundantly clear from context.</p>

            <summary id="superlatives">Q - How do I say that one thing is the best, the reddest, the most something, etc?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - There are a number of popular ways to do this, so I will list them.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Is anything really the best?</strong> Some toki pona speakers will use toki pona as an opprotunity to reëvaluate if anything can be the most something. For many toki ponists, it is enough to just say that something is very large, very fast, very bright, etc, and not the biggest, fastest, brightest, etc.</li>
              <li><strong>nanpa wan.</strong> In lipu pu, the phrase "nanpa wan" is used to mean "best," which makes sense, especially considering that the respective etymologies of "nanpa" and "wan" are, in their shared language of origin (Tok Pisin), a lexicalized compound (nambawan) that means "best." For example, "thank you" is "tenkyu," "thank you very much" is "tenkyu tru," and an even more extreme version of thanking (used in the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVlRhVzJDc0">Tinpis Run</a>) is "tenku tumas nambawan," which comes from "thank you too much number one," which I have started using in English because it is just fantastic. In Tok Pisin, "nambawan" actually means "best" or "most" directly. Likewise, in toki pona, people will use "nanpa wan" (which means "first") to mean "most," or sometimes on its own as "best." For example, "tomo tawa ni li loje nanpa wan" works great for "this bustaxi is the reddest." (A bustaxi is a Papuan truck with an open back that moves passangers around the country, and it is the main subject of the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVlRhVzJDc0">Tinpis Run</a>.) This method has the benefit of letting you replace "wan" with any number to mean "Nth most" or even with pini to mean "least." It is however more common to see people say "ike nanpa wan" than something like "pona nanpa pini" to mean "worst."</li>
              <li><strong>sewi.</strong> This usage is somewhat newer, but you will see people on occasion use "sewi" to mean "most." This usage of sewi can largely replace "nanpa wan" from the above method. This comes from sewi's "superior" meaning, and if "least" is a type of inferiority, anpa can work as an opposite here, but it's not as reliable because people don't use it that much. "sewi" is also mostly used with positive things, like best or healthiest, but rarely for negative things like "worst" or "most boring."</li>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - You can try. It’s very unlikely anyone will use them. Many people have tried, and especially after 2020, very few words at all have entered common use. If you use your own new words, people will likely be confused. toki pona was completed a while ago. It’s a living language, and it grows organically. <em>Especially</em> as a learner, wouldn’t it be weird to suggest changes to Spanish in Spanish class? Like “what if we didn’t gender anything.” It would be ridiculous. Suggesting a change to toki pona is likewise at the very least a little weird. But it happens. Another thing to consider is: why do you want to add the new word? Is it because you think toki pona needs it? A lot of people have thought this about a lot of concepts, but it’s not ever true. toki pona doesn’t need a new word for think or a new word for context - you can already talk about those concepts with preëxisting words. You probably just don’t know how to yet because you’re still learning, and that’s fine.</p>

              <summary id="unecessary-words">Some words in toki pona are unecessary.</summary>
              <p>This is accurate! In fact, all words in toki pona are unecessary, as is the entire language! It's all for fun, and words like "kili" and "pan" are indeed very fun to use. The only difference between these words and word proposals is that they are used by the majority of speakers already.</p>
              <p>It's also worth mentioning that these words usually have more nuanced semantic spaces than what they could be replaced with. Like kili is not just "moku kasi" or "kasi moku," it can also refer to parts of plants that aren't edible or related to eating. pan represents how humans interact with certain types of food (like staple grains). What toki pona <em>does</em> have should help guide you in figuring out what toki pona is trying to do, not the other way around.</p>

              <summary id="rude">Q - Can you be rude in toki pona?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Yeah. You can degrade someone as much as you can in English. I’d put an example, but I don’t really want to say mean things to the person reading. However, it’s a lot more difficult to be passive agressive about it. Passive agression usually relies on some level of hiddenness in meaning. Because it’s passive, people say one thing and intent something else. This is very difficult to pull off in toki pona, but soweli Nata came up with a good example. If someone’s cooking something, saying “a, ni li tawa soweli mani anu seme?” “oh, is this for a cow or something?” is just a question at face value, but it’s rude because you’re calling someone’s food animal food. There’s a lot of nuance that goes into insults in <em>any</em> language, but some people have said some horrible things to me. You can be rude or violent in toki pona, definitely.</p>

              <summary id="numbers">Q - The only number words are "wan, tu, mute," and that is inconvenient in order to do a lot of things. How would I talk about larger numbers?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Before reading this section, which talks about methods for discussing larger numbers, please read <a href="#numbers-philosophy"> this question</a>, which talks about how toki pona's philosophy interacts with numbers, and encourages the reader to rethink why they're using numbers in the first place.</p> 
              <p>That being said, it actually does get inconvenient on occasion. When I've met up with people in cities, giving directions using just toki pona is often annoying. But there are ways to get past that, such as using a number system from lipu pu where luka means five, mute means twenty, and ale means one hundred. For example, if I wanted to go to 228 st in the bronx, I could say "nasin nanpa ale ale mute luka tu wan." It will probably take an extra moment for people to process but it's very widely understood and definitely standard under any definition of "standard."</p>
              <p>For larger numbers, there is another somewhat uncommon but still understood method for talking about numbers called <a href="https://sona.pona.la/wiki/nasin_nanpa_pona">nasin nanpa pona</a>. My friend jan Kapilu came up with it and it works pretty well if you need to talk about bigger numbers, like higher tempuratures for cooking("tu tu ale mute mute luka luka" for 450 degrees instead of "ale ale ale ale mute mute luka luka"), dates (like "mute ale mute tu tu" for 2024 instead of "ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale mute tu tu"), and other things. That I can't think of a third example is evidence enough how specific the situations are for which nasin nanpa pona is required.</p>
              <p>If you want to avoid nasin nanpa pona for dates, there's the extremely silly but also probably widely understood method of using "owe" for "1984" and adding the amount of years between that date. This only works reliably for dates after 1984, but it's really funny and understandable to say "sike nanpa owe mute mute" for 2024. I recommend this exclusively because I love fun and I want to cause chaos.</p>

              <summary id="lexicalization">Q - What is "lexicalization" and why is it bad?</summary>
              <p>Lexicalization is when a word or phrase becomes a part of the lexicon of a language. A lexicon is the set of all words and phrases with their own meanings in the language. For example, "doorbell" is a lexicalized phrase because its meaning is greater than its parts. It isn't actually always a bell on a door. In fact, in English, we're likely to avoid saying "doorbell" to describe those little bells that some stores put on their doors so that they can hear when people enter and exit <em>because</em> a doorbell is usually a button next to a door that makes a noise when pressed. Another example might be "jew harp," which isn't actually a harp and isn't related to jews or judaism. Keep in mind that a lexicalized phrase doesn't have to be a compound word like "doorbell." Something like "old money" is still a lexicalized phrase because the money itself isn't actually old and "old money" refers to something different than what its parts would mean together.</p>
              <p>In toki pona, speakers avoid lexicalization like the plague for one very important reason among many: lexicalization increases the size of a language's lexicon. toki pona is so awesome <em>because</em> it has such a limited vocabulary. Any lexicalization increases the number of words and phrases in the language. Even though it's made of two words, "anu seme" is a grammaticalized phrase (which is like a lexicalized phrase but for grammatical words) that has a grammatical meaning beyond the normal meaning of its two parts together. This means that for however many words are in toki pona, there is one extra entry in the lexicon tht must be learned.</p>
              <p>Another reason why lexicalizations are avoided in toki pona is because as soon as a word gets lexicalized, it can no longer take on other meanings of a combination of its parts. Think about how "doorbell" can't refer to any bell related to any door without causing confusion. As soon as we lexicalize "sike tu" to mean bycicle, we can no longer use it to describe a turntable without causing confusion.</p>
              <p>To avoid lexicalization, speakers try to talk about concepts from new angles. For example, "tomo tawa" is a common lexicalization for "car" because it was used in Sonja Lang's first official book. In order to avoid increasing the size of the lexicon and cutting off the possible meanings of "tomo tawa," speakers try to use "tomo tawa" to refer to things that <em>aren't</em> cars and try to use other phrases <em>for</em> cars, like calling a house during an earthquake a tomo tawa and calling a car an ilo tawa (or even something creative and a little rediculous, like "soweli!").</p>
              <p>I'm not going to list common lexicalizations here because I think the people who use them are at some level aware of what they're doing. I'm sure that you can figure out when a phrase you're using is becoming lexicalized and take action to prevent that from happening. It's also important to mention that lexicalization is not the same as reusing a phrase to refer to the same thing in a single conversation because it doesn't add a word to the lexicon, it just ties concepts together as a type of context.</p>

              <summary id="calque">Q - What is a "calque" and why is it bad?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - In a general sense of all languages, a calque is an idiomatic phrase in a language that is a literal translation of an idiomatic phrase from another language. "Idiomatic" just means that something doesn't make sense when translated literally into every language, such as idiom or an idiomtic expression, like "Oh they've got my goat!" or "out of the frying pan and into the fire." An example of a calque in a natural language would be "pequeno almoço" in portuguese, which literally translates to "little lunch," but actually means "breakfast." This comes directly from "petit-déjeuner" in French, which also directly translates to "little lunch" but actually means "breakfast." The Portuguese "pequeno almoço" is only considered a calque because it comes from a direct translation of a phrase in a different language.</p>
              <p>Calques in toki pona are usually discouraged because they cannot be lexicalized <a href="#lexicalization">(click here if you don't know what that means)</a>. Let's look at an example of what I'm talking about with English and Tok Pisin. If I said "This place is an easy belly" and you didn't speak Tok Pisin, you would have no idea what I meant. In reality, this phrase in Tok Pisin (dispela hap i bel isi) would mean "this place is calm and peaceful." Because this calque isn't lexicalized in English, it isn't understandable. Any time someone calques in toki pona, unless the phrase already makes sense in toki pona without an outside perspective, it will not be understood as intended because lexicalized phrases do not occur most of the time.</p>
              <p>Some common examples of calques that come up with native English speaking toki pona learners are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li id="tenpo-monsi-before-tenpo-sinpin-after"><p><strong>"tenpo monsi" for "before" and "tenpo sinpin" for "after."</strong> English has a conceptual metaphor that puts time on a line that we walk forward along, which we can see in phrases like "let's move <strong>forward</strong> with this" and "I looked <strong>back</strong> to my past." Many languages have different conceptual metaphors with time in which people walk backwards through time, facing their past, not their future. toki pona doesn't have either conceptual metaphor, so neither "tenpo monsi" nor "tenpo sinpin" are used for "before" <em>or</em> "after."</p></li>
                <li id="kalama-sewi-anpa-high-low-pitch"><p><strong>"kalama sewi" for high pitches and "kalama anpa" for low pitches.</strong> English has a conceptual metaphor that places pitches in order from top to bottom. It runs so deeply in English that speakers of English can't talk about pitches without using words that also talk about height (try it! you will fail!). Turkish, in contrast, treats lower notes as "thick" and higher notes as "thin," so a Turkish toki pona speaker would have no idea what this meant! While it is true that for the human voice, lower notes can resonate lower in the body than higher notes, you can also sing lying down on the floor or upside down (and people do these things, especially in opera), not to mention that you can sing very low and control the resonance so that the note resonates in your head, and the opposite is also possible. My solution for this is usually to compare voices to the sounds made by soweli and waso, because waso are usually smaller than soweli and it's definitely not a calque of English. You could use "soweli lili" and "soweli suli" as tools here if you're worried about large birds and small mammals, but large birds are often flightless, and I don't use waso to describe flightless birds, so this is a moot point for me. "sama" is very useful here either way.</p></li>
                <li id="calque-pali"><p><strong>"pali" for "do."</strong> This for sure isn't always a calque, but the word "do" is used a lot in English for things that aren't the same concept in toki pona. "I'm doing homework" could be "mi pali lipu" because homework is work, but "I'm doing dishes" couldn't be "mi pali e ilo moku" because that reads as "I am making dishes". Likewise, "mi pali e supa lape" means "I'm creating a bed," not "I'm making a bed." I would use nasin or pona instead of pali there. Any time you see yourself using "pali" for something you'd use "do" for in English, reconsider if what you're describing is actually a type of work or a type of making something.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>"lukin" for "to look like."</strong> This calque is influenced a lot by how "lukin" sounds like the english word "looking." You may see learners of toki pona say things like "mi lukin sama soweli." This doesn't mean "I look like a dog." This means "I see like a dog." English uses the words "look" and "like" to mean "appear as," but toki pona doesn't.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>"esun" for "spending time."</strong> Another conceptual metaphor in English is "time is money." This shows up all over the way we talk about things. "I'm saving time." "I spent my time in France." "I'll buy us some time." Note how the words "save," "spend," and "buy" are all used for both time and money. This conceptual metaphor is baked into our lexicon. So even though these phrases make sense in English, "mi esun e tenpo" doesn't mean "I'm buying us some time." In fact, it probably refers to switching dates on a calendar, because toki pona has a conceptual metaphor where buying and selling are acts of swapping.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>As you can tell, a lot of calques in toki pona arise from a speaker's ignorance towards the conceptual metaphors in their mother tongue. This is for sure something to think about!</p>
              <p>One more thing to keep in mind: just because it is phrased like something in a different language doesn't mean it doesn't work natively in toki pona. For example, "I'm under the covers" can be "mi lon anpa len" because toki pona has the same conceputal metaphor as English in which it uses the same words for "hidden" to refer to types of cloths. This is by coincidence, and if a proficient speaker uses len like this, they aren't calquing English, they're just speaking toki pona.But my list isn't exhaustive, and you will be able to spot calques I didn't mention. If you think a calque is common enough for me to include here, feel free to let me know and i probably will!</p>

              <summary id="open-pini-preverbs">Q - Are "open" and "pini" preverbs?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Yeah kind of. I hardly ever see them in the wild, but a large portion of speakers consider themselves users of open and pini preverbs. The concepts of starting and stopping things may not come up that often, and for most speakers there are other ways of saying these concepts that feel more natural, like by using the preverb "kama" or by rephrasing it so that open and pini are a normal verb instead of a preverb. In reality, we don't have any reliable data on usage of these preverbs at the moment. I'm working on a paper on this and I've collected data with a somewhat large sample size (it's looking to be over 125), and once I publish the paper I will provide more accurate information here.</p>
              <p>I personally don't recommend using these words as preverbs because thinking about the concepts of starting and stopping and looking at how these manifest in the natural world is so much more interesting that using a preverb for it. Like what does it mean to start writing a book? The act of beginning to write a book may look like setting up a typewriter, or opening a document on a computer. Lots of things to think about!</p>

No word is considered vulgar by any stretch of the mind. Maybe eventually it will develop some but considering how concious of slurs the community is, I doubt it. Swears are much less of a deal than slurs. I fucking swear all the time. But in toki pona, there are no such words that are used like this.</p>

            <summary id="how-do-you-say">Specific complex concepts of interest and how to talk about them</summary>
              <p>There are a lot of concepts that people ask about very frequently. Each of these have come up at least once in the past month in my teaching.</p>
              <p>Before we explore how we can convey the concept, we need to ask ourselves: what <em>is</em> that concept? There's a reason toki pona doesn't have a word for these things, and that's because they are a complex concepts. toki pona's lack of a words for these concepts means that its speakers have to think deeply about what those concepts actually are. Here, I have in essense collected my thoughts about these common concepts and shared how I convey them and what they mean to you, but how you break down concepts like these may be completely different to how I do, and that says a lot about how we both see the world. If I use "jan poka" to describe what we would call a "friend" in English and you use "jan pona," that isn't insignificant. It means that we measure friendship completely differently, and simply through the act of communicating, the way we think becomes clear as clarified butter melted in a pan.</p>
              <p>For each of my answers here, there are probably a dozen toki ponists who disagree with me or have at the very least a slightly different perspective. There are some speakers who reject the concept of simplifying these thoughts entirely by coining new words to describe what they mean! For me, this takes the fun out of the language, but I don't have anything against it. This is not a good resource if you're looking for a list of fun new word proposals to try out. This section uses exclusively words mentioned in lipu pu (which may include kin or namako).</p>
              <p>And finally, a word of warning. Figuring out these things for myself may have been some of the hardest work I've ever done, but I learned a lot and had a lot of fun doing it. You are under no obligation to learn these things yourself now that I've made this resource, because it is a lot of work. But know that it can be more fulfilling and more fun in the moment to try to figure these things out and check back in here to compare our methods. (And if the way you say these things differs from mine, let me know! I may want to include your ideas either anonymously or with credit depending on what you want!)</p>

                <summary id="friend">Q - how would I say "friend" in toki pona?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - This is something I've wanted to write about for a while. The concept of a "friend" differs so much across not just different cultures but also across different members of the same culture. What my friends mean to me is different from what I mean to them. A lot of toki ponists have said that a friend is someone who is good, and therefore a good word for friend is "jan pona," but I disagree with the premise here. Friendship is a type of relationship between two people. "jan pona" doesn't describe a relationship, it describes nothing but your perspective of the person you're talking about. A friend can be a jan pona, but "jan pona" does not convey that relationship. For me, saying something like "jan mi" or "jan poka" is much better. This is because these phrases call to mind a specific relationship: my person, or a close person. For me, closeness is the most important part of friendship, so when I'm thinking in toki pona, I break down the concept of "friend" to "jan poka" a lot. If you feel that you'd break it down as "jan pona," please consider what concept you're talking about when you say the english word "friend" and if "jan pona" is really exemplifying that.</p>

                <summary id="think">Q - Why isn't there a word for "think" in toki pona?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - There <em>is</em> a word for think! "toki" is used very consistently by speakers to mean think as well as speak. I know that sounds confusing, but let me explain. the concept of "toki" is broader than the concept of talking. toki is any type of communication, be that internal or external. The only difference between thinking and talking is that with thinking, the recipient is internal, and with talking, the recipient is external. For this reason, it's very common to specify that thinking is internal by modifying "toki" with "insa." But it's not strictly necessary, because the spectrum that thinking and talking share has a lot of gray area. Is thinking out loud talking? Is talking to yourself thinking? Can you think out loud to yourself? Can you talk to yourself without talking? None of these questions permiate toki pona because toki pona uses only one word for all of these concepts. Just explain what is actually going on. When practicing toki pona, try to think about talking and thinking as the same basic idea with more clarified information.</p>

                <p><strong>A</strong> - There are actually <em>more than one</em> word for context! If you want to learn more about what exactly "context" means, scroll up or click <a href="#context">here</a> and translate some of those concepts to figure it out for yourself, but the long and short of it is that context is the information surrounding something. It's the nearby information. The sona poka! Context is very frequently a type of sona, and I feel that context is inherently close to something metaphysically, which is why "poka" works so well as a modifier in this example. You could also use any other word in place of sona. Like if you were talking about a piece of context that was also a dog, you could say "soweli poka." poka, metaphysically, means "relevant," and context is also in my opinion inherently relevant. You can also use "tenpo" to mean "situation," which is very useful for talking about specifically situational context.</p>

                <summary id="opposite">Q - How could I talk about the opposite of something? And couldn't toki pona save on words by having one word for "opposite" and removing half of the words?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - toki pona doesn't need to have a smaller vocabulary, and such a word would take away some of the fun semantic spaces we have. Like how "sinpin" can mean "wall," and "monsi" can mean "ass." An ass is not the opposite of a wall, at least not conceptually, so these words are not opposites even if they can talk about opposite directions. If you want to talk about an opposing direction, monsi can be very useful. For concepts of returning, "sin" is very useful as well. If you want to talk about an opposite meaning, you'll need to do a bit of thinking. The opposite of the "hidden" definition of "len" may very well be something like "jan li ken lukin e ona" or "jan mute li sona e lon ona." It may require a whole sentence like that. And there is no one clear opposite of the cloth meaning of len, so there's nothing to desire there. You can also use "poka" and "ante" to describe opposing sides of something. While it doesn't necesserily mean the opposite side, and may be a different other side, for things like rivers, there are only two sides anyway. These are just some ideas about how you can talk about opposites, but remember: the concept of an opposite is pretty weird and not always as useful as you think! Speaking a language without a word for opposite can pose a very interesting challenge.</p>

I think it works in a pinch but if you don't want to risk it, you can always get by with an incomplete list. "soweli en akesi en waso en ijo ante kin li lon" works for "animals are here," for example. "mi jo e akesi e waso e ijo ante sama" could be "I have lots of pet animals."</p>

                <summary id="sharpness">Q - how do I describe sharpness?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - The sharpness of an object, in my experience, is usually when an object is able to puncture or break open something, such as skin, paper, food, or building materials. What words we use to describe a sharp object are dependant on what that object is and how we puncture it. Paper, for example, is cut. Cutting is "tu," so we can use "ilo tu" to describe scissors, or maybe even a whole sentence, such as "ilo ni li tu e lipu." Skin is opened or wounded, so a sharp object used to cut into skin (like a scalpal) could be an "ilo pi open selo." To contrast, a potato peeler doesn't open the outer layer of the potato, it removes it. So it could be an "ilo pi weka selo." <strong>Graphic context of harm ahead.</strong> Now if a sharp object is used to harm skin (like a sword), we can use pakala instead. A sword can be contrasted from a club by its sharpness, so saying "ilo ni li pakala e selo" is very useful. You can of course still use open here. If a sword is meant to cut through bone and sever limbs, you could even use "ilo tu"! <strong>Graphic content is over.</strong> Knives used for cooking cut food into small pieces, so tu works best here. A carving tool, which is sharp, could be described as a tool that sculpts the selo of stone, wood, or clay.</p>
                <p>Most of the time, if I need to convey sharpness in an emergency, it's because of a risk of harm. So if I need to say something like "careful, that's sharp!" I will say "ni li ken open e selo!" or "ni li ken pakala e selo!"</p>

                <summary id="glass">Q - How would I describe glass in toki pona?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - Glass is hard, so you can use kiwen! But when we think of hard substances, we're not usually thinking about what light can pass through, because most of the time, the light we can see can't pass through kiwen. But glass is one of a few exceptions to this rule. Some other types of kiwen that let some light through might be translucent, which you could describe by saying that you can see light coming from behind it (tan monsi ona), but you can't see what the light is coming from. Some glass indeed falls under this description, but most of the glass we talk about day to day lets enough light through that we can make out what is behind the kiwen. Glass like this can be easy as something like "it's a kiwen, and I can see what's on its other (back) side (lon poka monsi ona).</p>
                <p>I have an alternative perspective on glass, too! I use lupa for a lot of things that glass goes in, like windows, telescopes, microscopes, etc. I will usually use kiwen to describe the substance itself, but the way that I clarify glass is by saying that it is a lupa, but only for light. Here I can describe what kind of light. Can humans see it? Does it change the shape (selo) of the light at all? Does it only let through some colors of light? Does it make an image appear bigger or smaller? I can answer all these questions by describing the image going through a lupa.</p>

                <summary id="specific-sounds">Q - How would I describe a sigh, cough, hiccup, clap, snap, or some other nuanced sound with meaning?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - This comes a lot in my personal translation projects, because in English, writers love describing all the little noises their characters make one by one. In reality, you can just use "mu" for these, but in a translation I like to specify by modifying the mu with their feelings. Maybe a sigh could be a "mu pi pilin ike." Depending on the sigh, it could be more complicated. "mu li toki e ni: sijelo ona li awen wile utala, taso ona li kama wile ala li lawa utala e sijelo." Which could mean "The sigh conveyed that as much as he wanted to continue arguing, he willed himself to calm down." In other languages, showing and not telling is much easier because of the robust vocabulary. In toki pona, you often just have to say things how they are.</p>
                <p>Some of the examples from the question are body language. You can use "kalama luka" for most of these, and specify further what that means with combinations of intent/emotion and descriptions of the sound itself. Is it loud? What contexts is it appropriate to use such a sound in your culture? Answering even just one of these questions can help people understand you.</p>

                <summary id="smells">Q - How do you talk about smells, scents, etc?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - kon and nena are fantastic for these! I use "nena" as a verb to mean "sniff," much like I may use uta to mean "bite" or "nibble." As for descriptions of scents themselves, the nitty gritty of aroma in English is already hard enough for me to wrap my head around, but I often compare the scents to objects with known scents. I think that toki ponists who talk about aroma and scents would make fantastic wine tasters because they're always picking apart nuances to help distinguish very complex and subtle aromas. Memories can also play a role in how we interpet aroma. In reality, English has many of the same pitfals. You can't really know how something smells until you smell it, unless you are doing research on aromatic compounds, in which case you could maybe figure it out, but only if you had enough experience to begin with.</p>

                <summary id="hugs">Q - How do you say "hug" in toki pona?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - Some fun ideas I've seen include "jo" (framing it as holding), "selo" (which calls images of protection to mind, because the selo of something protects the insides), and "sijelo" ("apply body to"). "luka" is also very common. I have said all of these within the past couple of months!</p>

                <summary id="glue">Q - How might I describe something sticky, like glue? What about magnets?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - "awen" is good to describe the quality of something sticking. "ken ala weka" is also useful here to describe that it can't be removed. Adhesives are usually a type of ko, but they may also be telo. I think the big difference between glue and magnets for toki pona is that when you unstick magnets, they don't break anything, but when you unstick something that has been sealed with an adhesive, it often leaves a residue or breaks the object that was glued together. They do say that wood glue is stronger than the wood itself, after all. There are exceptions to this, like command strips, which can be removed easily without damaging anything or leaving any residue.</p>

                <summary id="fluffy">Q - How do you describe fluffy soft things, like fur, clouds, foam, etc.?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - Two important words here are ko and linja. linja is used a lot to describe fur or similar textures made up of lots of hairs. ko can also describe these, and works especially well for objects that can change shape, like a pillow or something else made out of foam. Seafoam, bubbles in a bubble bath, and foamed milk can easily be ko, but consider that depending on how fine the bubbles are, sike might work better.</p>
                <p>Another common word here is "suwi," beacuse it can denote a pleasant sensory experience, but not every soft or fluffy thing is pleasant. I recommend using "jaki" instead of "suwi" to describe mold, for example. Things can have soft or fluffy textures and be very not suwi.</p>

              <summary id="math">Q - Math</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - One thing I think a lot of people don't get about math is that it isn't just numbers. You can represent most math without numbers at all. You can prove the pythagorean theorem without using numbers at all. Pythagoras sure did. But the key for talking about math in toki pona is realizing that in order to teach math in the best way possible, you must teach with visuals. The moment you let yourself talk about math with visuals in ANY language, the more fun you'll have, and the more easily you'll learn.</p>
              <p>Anecdotally, I learned what a derivative was in a toki pona only environment and aced a test on derivatives the next day, no English instruction required. I had a good teacher who spoke toki pona well and was patient enough to teach math to me. If I had already known how derivatives worked, it would have been really easy to start clarifying concepts in a barebones way until the other person understood enough to cut me off, and the opposite would have been true as well.</p>

              <summary id="politics">Q - Politics</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - So politics can definitely be tricky to talk about in toki pona. But I believe this is due to the nature of buzzwords. Many a time have I had a discussion with someone in english and mentioned terms like "power dynamic" and "systemic oppression" or even "racism," and the mere mention of these ideas shut down the entire conversation. Given, I was talking to someone who was not open to the concept that he might benefit from the suffering of others, but even so, it was the use of these words that shut down the conversation, not the meanings of them.</p>
              <p>toki pona completely lacks this issue because of its limited vocabulary! In order to talk about politics, you need to say what you mean without using politically charged terms. The best way to demonstrate this is with examples so for this section I'm going to eventually include more than just one.</p>
              <p>I'm not a politician or political scientist. I spend a lot of time thinking about social injustice.

            <summary>Confusing spatial concepts</summary>
              <p>A lot of learners struggle with certain concepts of spatial relations. It's easy to say "at" or "on" or "towards" or "from," but what if it's a little more complex than that?</p>

              <details open>
                <summary id="through-across">Q - How do I say "through" and "across" in toki pona?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - Whenever the term "through" comes up in English, an object is moving through something else. The semantic space of lupa is in part based on the concept that things can move through them. Saying "X li tawa lon lupa" is generally understood to mean either "through" or "into," depending on wether the lupa in question is a thurough-hole or not. You can get around this by describing two opposing sides of a lupa, and say that something arrived at the other side. The only way to move lon lupa and come up on the other side is through, so this works! I like this method because it uses the word "lupa," which I'm quite fond of.</p>
                <p>"Across" is almost exactly the same, but where objects travel through lupa, objects travel across supa, usually. The information in these prepositions in english can be clarified outside of a prepositional phrase in toki pona, and I think that's really cool.</p>

                <summary id="beyond">Q - How do you say "beyond"?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - "weka" is great here. A lot of learners haven't discovered how crucial "weka" is to toki pona's spatial system. weka describes a location or object that is not present, either through an act of removal or through having never been there in the first place. But sometimes "beyond" also conveys the idea of existing outside of an outer layer of an object. If I am beyond a wall, I am at the weka of the "selo" of that which the wall protects.</p>
                <p>There also exist nonphysical usages of "beyond" in English. It is still crucial to beware of calques, but weka can still be used metaphorically in toki pona. You just need to bring the metaphor into the physical. For example, "she's beyond reason!" could be "mi lon ma pi sona pona. ona li lon weka pi ma ni!" which means "We're in the land of reason. She is beyond it (the land of reason)!"</p>

                <summary id="distance">Q - How do you talk about distance and measurements?</summary>
                <p>I think the most useful thing to do here is try to figure out how we can frame distance using the vocabulary already in toki pona. Usually we frame distance as either near (poka) or far (weka). In many cases, all you need to do is say how far the distance is relatively.</p>
                <p>Where this gets tricky is with exact measurements. Most of the time it's easy to avoid these, but if you need to talk about more specific units of distance, a method I sometimes use is landmark distances. For example, if I wanted to say that two cities were as close to each other as New York and Boston, if that distance didn't sound too far to me, I may say "poka pi ma ni tu ni li sama poka pi ma tomo Newa Jo pi ma tomo Poson." "The closeness of these two cities is the same as the distance of new york city and boston."</p>
                <p>Another really useful tool here is to use time and method of transportation, which may be more useful than a specific distance anyway. Sometimes it's more useful to know upfront how long a flight from one place to another is. You can use some of the strategies in the <a href="#time">time section</a> to talk about how long it takes to walk, drive, or fly somewhere (or any other mode of transportation).</p>

            <summary id="time">Time</summary>
              <p>Time is a big thing that a lot of people struggle with in toki pona, so here are a few common questions about it collected together.</p>
              <details open>
                <summary id="time-units">Q - How do I talk about specific units of time (hours, minutes, seconds)?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - This is how I usually do it:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>I describe an analogue clock. Clocks have three hands of three sizes. I use "palisa" for these hands, because "luka" doesn't describe what they are well at all. The largest one demonstrates seconds, and it's often red. The smallest one demonstrates hours, and the middle one demonstrates minutes, and those two are usually black.</li>
                  <li>I switch my way of thinking about time over to an analogue clock. I can feel the seconds passing as the long red hand ticks steadily. Then I can feel my concept of minutes pulling me faster as the middle length hand turns around the clock, a full hour, and finally I can feel the day slipping away as the hour hand, the shortest of them all, turns a full circle, pushing hard against the resistence of time.</li>
                  <li>Now that I can conceputalize whatever unit of time (or moment of time in the day), I simply use "palisa suli," "palisa lili," and "palisa insa" to talk about how long something takes (or I add nanpa before all the numbers if it's a specific time of day, and clarify if the sun is risen, rising, falling, or fallen if it's ambiguous). For example, "In about two hours I'll return" may be "ilo tenpo li jo e palisa tu wan. palisa lili li tawa sike lon tenpo tu la mi kama sin." "Unfortunately I woke up at 4:45 AM and couldn't fall asleep again" may be "o lukin insa e ilo tenpo pi palisa tu wan. sewi li pimeja la palisa lili li lon nanpa tu tu. palisa insa li lon nanpa mute mute luka. ike la tenpo ni la mi kama weka tan lape. mi ken ala lape sin."</li>
                </ol>
                <p>There are other ways, but this one fits toki pona best if you need to be precise. But make sure to consider: do you need to be precise? If so, how precise do you need to be? For the second example, you could have rounded up to 5 AM or just said that it was still dark outside when I woke up.</p>
                <p>Some people have <a href="#lexicalization">lexicalized</a> "tenpo ilo" as "hour" and I hate it. Please do not do this.</p>
              </details>
              <br>

              <details open>
                <summary id="tense">Q - How do I specify when something happens? Like was vs is vs will be.</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - As you probably know already, toki pona is tenseless, which means that this information is not required in order to speak grammatically. But what if you <em>want</em> to convey this information? Well, "kama" and "pini" are your friends. In lipu pu, among their definitions are "future" and "past" respectively, because the past is what is finished now, and the future is what is coming now. But be careful; because of toki pona's lack of tense, pini can mean "will be finished" and kama can mean "has already come." <a href="#context">Context</a> is your friend here.</p>
                <p>As for the present, there are a couple of common methods. The first uses "tenpo ni" to mean "this time" in the sense that you can point at the current situation. Dispite what some people may claim, this is no more of a lexicalization than "soweli ni" is a lexicalization for any dog you could point at. But be careful, because much like tenpo kama and tenpo pini, this could mean "that time" and talk about a specific time or situation that you have (or will) mention(ed).</p>
                <p>Another common method is to say "tenpo lon," which is in fact sometimes lexicalized, but not by most people who use it. "tenpo lon" makes sense for "now" because it is the time that exists. However, this is subject to the same pitfalls as "tenpo ni" in that it can talk about a time that did exist, or a time that will exist, rather than the time that exists right now. There is also the issue in which "lon tenpo lon" for "during now" has lon in it twice, which may be confusing. All of these usually follow prepositional "lon" (or come before la) because lon can mean "during" and none of the other prepositions can mean that. </p>

                <p>Now with that out of the way, how DO people talk about things happening "before" or "after" other things? Here are some methods that I use:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I use la. it's 5 AM I'm not writing all that.</li>

                <summary id="tenpo-dropping">Q - What is tenpo dropping? I've seen some mentions of it.</summary>
                <p>tenpo dropping isn't really a real thing people do. It's based on a poor analysis of semantic shift in the word "suno" based on a reframing of time units in the community. For example, a day could be framed not just as a type of tenpo related to the sun, but also just as a type of sun itself. Each day, the sun that rises is a new sun, after all. This philosophy fits toki pona pretty well.</p>
                <p>Does this work for other words besides "suno" though? Well, fewer people use "esun" to mean "week" than people use "mun" to mean "month," and fewer people use "mun" to mean "month" than people use "suno" to mean "day," but the same people who use "sike" for "year" (which is how it is used and described in pu) probably also use "suno" to mean "day," making it much more common.</p>
                <p>"tenpo dropping" is misanalyzing the semantic shift of these words as dropping the head of the phrase, which is "tenpo," instead of a reframing of the concept of a day as a type of suno and not as a type of tenpo.</p>
                <p>An example of this semantic shift that works the best is "pimeja" for "night." Many languages use a word for "dark" to mean night, and perhaps the night is indeed a type of darkness, not a type of time.</p>

            <summary id="proper-names">Proper names</summary>
              <p>Names can be a very important part of any language, so this section explores how names work in toki pona.</p>

              <details open>
                <summary id="how-do-names-work">Q - How do names work in toki pona?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - There are a few ways to do names, and here are the most common ones: tokiponization, calquing, or making up a new name. I'll go over all three methods here.</p>
                <p><strong>tokiponization</strong> is the process of taking a word from a different language and changing the way it sounds to fit the rules of toki pona pronunciation. The exact way of doing this can differ a bit from person to person, but Sonja Lang wrote <a href="https://jan-ne.github.io/tp/tpize">these guidelines</a> that are very commonplace. After loaning a word into toki pona like this, we capitalize it and put it after a different word, depending on what kind of thing it is. If the thing with a name is a type of kili, we put the name directly after "kili." These tokiponized names are often called "proper adjectives" because they only ever serve as adjectives and can't be used on their own. The one exception to this rule is in a sentence with the word "nimi" in it. Things like "nimi mi li San" (my name is San) and "nimi la ona li Atawan" (namewise they are Atawan) are both common and grammatical, but they only work because the word "nimi" shows up in the sentence to show that the loanword is acting as a name. Note that nothing I've said here is a hard and fast rule. You WILL find people who use tokiponized names and don't follow all these rules (such as jan Deni, who uses a D in their name despite toki pona not allowing D, lipamanka (me) who doesn't capitalize my name or give it a head noun, or people who don't have a specified <a href="#headnoun">headnoun</a> and have people just use whatever).</p>
                <p>Note that tokiponization is not limited to the names of people. Languages, places, vehichles, or anything else with a name can spoken about in toki pona using a tokiponized name. Just make sure that you're tokiponizing the word that the members of a group related to the concept use to describe themselves (an endonym), rather than a word used by a different group (exonym). This is really important because it keeps toki pona equally acessible to speakers of all languages and all groups, and it can also help increase your knowledge of what groups of people call themselves. I recommend trying to find indigenous names for places and tokiponizing those, and using them instead of whatever a colonizer named the place. Like I call Minnesota "ma Min Sota Masoke" and New York "ma poka pi ma Mana Ata" which are both based off of the indigenous names of those locations.</p>
                <p><strong>Calquing</strong> for a name is different than calquing in general. Calquing is usually bad in toki pona (see <a href="#calque">here</a> to learn more), but for names, it's fine! A calqued name is simple: If your name in a different language has a meaning, translate the meaning into toki pona words instead of transliterating the sounds into toki pona sounds. If someone's name is "April," their toki pona name could be "tenpo mun," and that's pretty fucking cool. If someone's username on an online chatroom website is "MathLizard," their toki pona name could be "akesi nanpa." This is my personal favorite way of doing names in toki pona. It's really cool!</p>
                <p><strong>Making up a new name.</strong> This one is exactly what it sounds like. Take either of the two methods above, but instead of taking sounds or meaning from somewhere else, just come up with entirely new ones! Wanna try out being "ko"? Go for it, that can be your name. You are now a semisolid and that's really cool. What about "jan Akapelijanela"? I just made up those syllables like right now and that's really cool too. (Though consider making it shorter so others can remember it more easily.)<!-- olgeta hap i oista bilong yu! --></p>
                <p><strong>REMEMBER:</strong> these methods are not exhaustive. There are other ways to do names! You can also abstain from making a toki pona name! Just continue to use a name from a different language. "Charles li pona mute." This is totally fine if it's what you want to do.</p>

                <summary id="meli-Sonko">Q - Can I use the name of a place as an adjective to mean "of that place"? For example, can I say "supa Juwese" for a table manufactured in the United States?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - This question is debated somewhat among tokiponists, but the consensus I've observed among proficient speakers is that you can't. Proper names are just names, and "Juwese" doesn't mean "the United States of America," it's just a name. "supa Juwese" reads as a table that is named Juwese, not a table from the united states. This whole question is usually refered to as "meli Sonko," which references how lipu pu translates "Chinese woman" as "meli Sonko." "Sonko" is a tokiponization of Zhōngguó, which is an endonym for China. In most speakers's modern usage, this would mean "a woman named Sonko," not "a woman from a place named Sonko." However, there are a handful speakers who use proper names in the <em>meli sonko</em> style out there.</p>

                <summary id="headnoun">Q - What is a "headnoun" and how do I choose mine?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - A "headnoun" is, in the context of names, the word that comes before a name in toki pona. What something is will change what head noun you use for it. For a pet bird, "waso" is the most apt headnoun. For a country, "ma" is the most apt headnoun. But you are your own being and you have the choice to decide what you are and what word you want to use to represent that. toki pona gives you an opprotunity to experiment with your identity in a really silly way. You can use language to redefine what you are! It's great! For people, the most common head noun is definitely "jan," but you can use any word that isn't a grammatical particle as a head noun. It doesn't have to make sense, it just needs to be meaningful for you.</p>

                <summary id="country-names">Q - How important is it to know country names?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - For conversation in toki pona? They come up sometimes, but not a lot, depending on what you're talking about. In practice if I haven't known a country someone was talking about, they either say what it is in a different language, usually english (like "toki Inli la ma Nijon li Japan"), and then I know, or they try to describe it or name some nearby countries (perhaps: ona li lon poka pi ma Sonko li lon telo li ma mama pi moku ni: sina selo e pan kepeken lipu pimeja pi kasi telo li pana e kala lon insa). I prefer the second method but it might not always work if the listener doesn't know much about the culinary traditions and geography of Japan.</p>
                <p>For you as a person though? Going through the process of learning what each country calls itself is really quite the boon and I recommend it. I certainly don't know every name of every country in its national language or most spoken language, but if I want to name a place its always a fun process to check to see what the dominant culture there calls it, and better yet for some places, what the INDIGENOUS culture calls it. Like I could call new york "ma Nujo," but why do that when I can call Manhattan "ma Mana Ata" (from [double check this] Mudsee Lenape "manaháhtaan") and say "that and nearby places towards the cold direction and the direction the sun rises in." I can decolonize the way i talk about New York AND delegitimize Staten Island at the same time!! easy! win-win. </p>

            <summary id="phrasebook">Phatic Phrases/Phrasebook</summary>
            <h3 id="phatic-phrases">Q - What is a phatic phrase?</h3>
            <p>"Phatic phrases" are language-specific phrases like "hello" "how's your day going" "goodbye" and "thank you" that are used as a curtosy in everyday conversation. I have yet to encounter a natural language that doesn't have any of these. All of these "phatic phrases" are lexicalized phrases (phrases that are fixed and have additional meaning beyond the sum of their parts), and lexicalization should be avoided in toki pona (click <a href="#lexicalization">here</a> to learn why), so specific repeated phatic phrases should also be avoided. But that doesn't stop people from wondering how to say things!</p>
            <p>Here I've put together an unorthodox phrasebook. Unlike other phrasebooks, I explain how to get your point across without using fixed phrases. There are common ways to say all these things, and I'll mention all of them here, but I'm also going to show you how to spice up the way you interact with people.</p>
            <p>This <em>will</em> be a lifestyle change. I've been working up my ability to replace phatic phrases in english with novel experiences. In an intro to linguistics class once I walked in late on the day we were learning about phatic phrases and said "hello, genders" to the people at my table. They explained to me the irony because we were keeping track of what each other said first thing when they arrived. Apparently I was the only one who said something interesting. And I attribute this completely to how I've learned to rephrase these ideas in toki pona, which lacks specific phatic phrases.</p>
            <p>If you want to figure these out on your own, though, which I cannot recommend enough, here are some steps to take:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>What function does the phrase serve? In essence, what does the phrase communicate that isn't directly in its meaning?</li>
              <li>Translate that function into toki pona.</li>
              <li>Say that!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The process may be difficult to understand right off the bat, but that's why I have examples for you! I tried my best to cover all common phatic phrases, but once you see me work you through the process a few times you may be able to figure these out on your own (which is really really fun!).</p>
            <p>A common thread in this section is my own analysis of how I use these phrases and interact with them, because the way I talk to people and interact in general is atypical. The rules around which of these terms you're supposed to use when never came easily to me. I had to be taken out of class all the way through high school to be taught how to engage with others like this in my culture (part of my individualized education program (IEP) was speech therapy for "pragmatics"). I have bolded more important information to make skimming easier.</p>

            <details open>
              <summary id="hello">Q - How would I greet people, like "hello" or "greetings"?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - When I say "hello," I often don't need to. Sometimes I say it when I'm passing by someone. I don't really use "hello" the same way most people do. I'm more likely to say it multiple times after five minutes have elapsed since I encounter someone. It's a fun word and I like greeting people more once I've already been talking to them. In Anglophone culture, this is considered weird.</p>
              <p>However, usage of this word in English can differ from place to place. In New York City, where I'm from, nobody has time for you. You would never even think about talking to a stranger most of the time (though I have had fantastic conversations with strangers on the subway). But in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and Saint Paul, where I live now), and in New England (which is where I spent some of my childhood), it is customary to wave or say "hello" to someone if you walk past them on the side of the road, or even on the sidewalk of a less urban place. Upon moving to the Twin Cities, the usage of the word "hello" bewildered me. Why is everyone using it so much?</p>
              <p>So for function, the reality is that <strong>the majority of the time, "hello" and such are curteous and not actually communicating anything. Therefore, in toki pona contexts, you can usually omit them.</strong></p>
              <p>However, many speakers will want a way to initiate a conversation. The first thing I realized here is that often when I say hi, I'm looking for someone else to come up with a fun topic to talk about. Now, <strong>instead of saying "hello," I'm more often to ask a specific question to get the ball rolling.</strong> It's generally more successful.</p>
              <p><strong>All this being said, in toki pona, a common way to say "hello" is to evoke that which you desire (a conversation) by simply saying the word for conversation: "toki." You can do this with other things too, of course. "waso" could evoke the image of a bird on its own, and in the presence of birds, works very well as "hello," perhaps even better than "toki."</strong></p>
              <p>Another common way I greet people is to say their name really excited. I even have one friend named Basil for whom we greet each other with our own names. So I would yell "lipamanka!" really excitedly and she would respond "omg Basil! is that you?" That is a weird thing that the two of us do and it may not work very well in toki pona, but I almost always greet my roommate by exitedly exclaiming "OMG LYLE!!" Likewise, <strong>in toki pona, it's common to greet someone with just their headnoun (like "waso o" or "jan o" or something) or their name (like "waso Keli o" or "jan Kopijan o").</strong></p>
              <p>And finally, <strong>you can just say "mu."</strong> This is incredibly common and I love it so much. It's really effective.</p>
              <p>I have replaced the names of real people who aren't public figures in toki pona spaces in this section with fake names that still fit their vibes.</p>

                <summary id="good-morning">Q - What about more time specific greetings, like "good morning" and "good night"?</summary>
                <p>I try to avoid these. One of the languages I speak (though admittedly not very well) is my ethnic language, Yiddish. In Yiddish, you will hear "gut morgen" (lit. "good morning") all day long until the sun sets. Except for on Saturday, where you will hear "gut shabes." This is also the case in some Anglophone Jewish communities, including the one I'm a part of where I live.</p>
                <p>I bring this up to say that time specific greetings are extremely language specific. <strong>You can say "suno pona" while the sun's out and "pimeja pona" when it's dark, but you can also say "kasi pona" when you walk under a tree and "supa pona" when you sit down to eat.</strong> There's this one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtnoK-kf3uc">clip</a> of Gandalf talking about the possible interpretations of "good morning" that is very apt here. Why must you say it at all, and why not describe everything else as good when it is such?</p>

              <summary id="goodbye">Q - How do I say "goodbye"?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - This one is interesting because the English word comes from "god be with you." In fact, this is true for a lot of different European languages, including spanish "adiós" and portuguese "adeus" (both meaning "to god"). So if your intent is indeed to say something along these lines, you can say "sewi o awen lon sina" or something.</p>
              <p>Another term, "farewell," comes from "fare thee well"/"fare you well," which is similar to "be well." This is most similar to how people say goodbye in toki pona.<strong>You can certainly say "o pona" when leaving someone, or when someone is leaving you. But something I like to do is use "pona" as a modifier for a verb describing what they're doing. If someone is chrocheting, I may say "o pali pona linja." "work well on your string." If someone is eating, I may say "o moku pona" "eat well" upon leaving. In general, if I'm leaving, "awen pona" works well, because the other person is remaining. If someone else is leaving me, "tawa pona" or "o tawa pona" seems most relevant, and is a very kind thing to say (wishing that someone travel well or approach something good). I like to pay attention to what people are doing and wish them to do it well.</strong></p>
              <p>In the midwest, when people are leaving, they often stand up and say "Ope! Best be goin' now." Likewise, <strong>in toki pona you can just say "I'm leaving" ("mi tawa" or "mi kama weka" or something similar works great here). Just make sure that whatever you say, it makes sense in the context. Don't say "tawa pona" to someone who's still eating sushi; say "o moku e kala pona."</strong></p>

              <summary id="how-are-you">Q - How do I ask "how are you," "how's it going," "how are you feeling," etc?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Something I didn't know until I learned about it in a sociolinguistics class is that when people ask "how are you?", it's atypical to answer with anything other than "good" (or "well" if you don't belive in adverb "good"). I thought that one was supposed to evaluate their emotional state and respond accurately. So I would frequently respond to these questions with "bad" (or later, in high school, "tired"). Now I'm more likely to ignore them and cut to the chase, but "tired" is definitely a go-to response.</p>
              <p>Once, in a job interview, I distinctly remember the interviewer asking "how are you doing?" and responding "I'm doing very well, thank you for asking, and I'm happy that you're doing well as well" dispite them not telling me that. So this is one of the reasons I avoid answering the question, the other reason being that I have in the past few years learned that "how are you" usually isn't actually a genuine mental health check in.</p>
              <p><strong>If you really want to know how someone is feeling in toki pona, you can ask them with something like "pilin sina li seme?" or "sina pilin pona anu seme?" but both of these will be treated as emotional check-ins and not as phatic phrases. It is atypical to ask strangers what their emotions are.</strong> (I do in fact often say "what are your emotions" to people I don't know very well instead of "how's it going.") <strong>But most of the time, it's good to just not say something that means "how are you."</strong></p>

              <summary id="welcome">Q - How do I say "welcome!" and the like?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Luckily, this one is easy! "Welcome" is composed of "well" and "come," and it is a statement wishing someone a good arrival. <strong>If you want to do this in toki pona, you can just translate "good arrival" as "kama pona" and call it a day.</strong> However, it may be interesting to switch </p>

              <summary id="please">Q - How would I say "please"?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - In English (and many other languages), directly telling someone to do something is considered too direct and rude. Adding "please" is one of many tools Anglophones use to make it easier to tell someone to do something without sounding rude. In fact, we use the word "ask" in english to describe the most common method of telling someone to do something, because we often phrase commands as questions in English ("can you please pass the butter?" instead of "pass the butter please," though both are used).</p>
              <p>toki pona isn't like this at all! <strong>It is not considered rude at all to tell someone to do something in toki pona. Just say "o pana e ni tawa mi." You don't need a word for "please."</strong> A lot of people say that toki pona is "polite by default" due to this, but that's a misunderstanding. The direct translation of a command in toki pona will always sound rude in English, but that's only because commands in English sound rude, not because commands in all languages are rude.</p>
              <p>Now sometimes it is actually useful to ask someone if they're able to do something. "sina ken ala ken pali tawa mi" "are you able to do this work for me," for example. This is directly asking if someone is able to do something, not a request that someone do something.</p>

                <summary id="thank-you">Q - What do I say for "thank you" after someone does something nice for me?</summary>
                <p><strong>A</strong> - When we thank someone, we are just being curtious. We don't need to communicate anything extra besides our gratitude, our well wishes for someone else, or praise to the person who did the thing. <strong>To show gratitude, you can say that something made you feel good or describe better what effect it had on you. To wish someone well, you can say "pona o tawa sina" or "pona tawa sina," both of which are very common. If you want to praise their actions, you can say "sina pona" or describe what they did (like if someone sang a song for you, you could say "sina mu pona").</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>A</strong> - The back and forth of "please" "thank you" "you're welcome" in English is kind of exhausting for me. It's a lot to keep in mind. I'm embedding three details elements inside of each othere here. But in any case, it can still be nice to respond when someone thanks you for something. <strong>Repeating what they said can work sometimes, or changing the verb based on the context (if someone thanks you by saying "sina pali pona e moku," you can say "sina moku pona e moku" as a response). You can also say a simple "sina pona" or say nothing at all.</strong></p>
