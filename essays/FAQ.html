              <summary id="what-is-toki-pona">Q - What is toki pona?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - toki pona is a language, just like many others. Two main things set it apart from most other languages:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>toki pona was created by one person with a specific goal in mind</li>
                <li>toki pona has an extremely small vocabulary.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>toki pona has lots of other qualities that make it unique, and if you keep reading, you'll learn about many of them! Usually the information I've shared so far sparks curiosity. If you have any questions that aren't answered in this page, please fill out <a href="https://lipamanka.gay/essays/FAQ#form">the question submission form below</a> and I will likely add it to this page as quickly as I can.</p>

              <summary id="1how-many-words">Q - So how many words does toki pona have?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Like, around 120. Some people get mad at this number. There are a lot of words out there, and a lot of them are in use. In the official toki pona dictionary, toki pona is shown to have 137 "essential" words and an additional few dozen words that are not as important to the language. But in my time speaking toki pona, I hardly ever see a conversation where more than one of these additional words beyond the 120 are used. To be fair, this is also the case for a set of the original 120, but the 120 are unambiguously part of almost all speakers’ vocabularies. I usually say “around 120 words” because without this nuance, any other number would be a little misleading and raise a lot of questions. 137 is a really specific number and isn’t particularly accurate. “About 200” is way too high of an estimate, because most speakers and conversations never even come close to reaching that threshold.</p>

            <details>
              <summary id="easy-to-learn">Q - If there are only around 120 words, wouldn't toki pona be really easy to learn? Could I get fluent in just a month? Two weeks? A few days? 30 hours? Three hours?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - It’s possible to get conversational very fast. It took me about three days to get through the whole vocabulary, though it took me a couple of months to refine that, and it took me years to feel their semantic spaces like I feel English’s. If you want to learn toki pona because you think it’ll be faster than other languages, there may be some truth to that, but think about what you want to get out of learning a language. Community? Philosophy? A new outlook on life? To prove a point? To know what it’s like? Because the language you want to learn was taken from you generations ago? Because the language seems interesting? There are so many reasons to want to learn a language, and all of these reasons have motivated me to learn a language, be that Portuguese, Yiddish, or toki pona. toki pona isn’t a thing you can learn in a day, but you can still learn part of it in a day. It’s a journey, and the journey for learning toki pona is unique and unlike any other language I’ve encountered. Every bit of practice helps you learn, but all in all I wouldn’t claim proficiency for at least a month and I would be wary about claiming fluency until six months in.</p>

              <summary id="who-made-toki-pona">Q - Who made toki pona?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Sonja Lang! She's a cool lady. I've met her a couple of times in person and she's always really kind and fun to spend time with. She plays chess, studies Malay, and often likes to keep to herself, though she frequents online communities and attends IRL meetups. She doesn't like it when people put her on a pedestal and she prefers to be treated like any other toki ponist. Please respect her!</p>

            <details>
              <summary id="what-is-toki-pona-for">Q - What is toki pona for?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Nobody except for Sonja Lang was in Sonja Lang's head from 2000 to 2001, when she was working on the language. She has gone on to say that she attempted to describe the meaning of life using a language with 100 words or fewer, but it's not clear why she wanted this or if this was her only motivation. In reality, toki pona began as a personal language for Sonja Lang and nobody else. She shared it with the world, and now, two decades later, it's a living language with lots of speakers who would all answer this question differently. So while toki pona was made with a specific purpose, its purpose now is up to its speakers, and I encourage everyone reading this to explore what toki pona is for, for themselves.</p>

              <summary id="why-learn-toki-pona">Q - Why would anyone want to learn toki pona?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Why would anyone learn how to play a banjo recreationally? Not everything we have to do needs to be useful, so why would that be the same for language learning? Some people do it for fun. For others, the philosophy and design goals of the langauge appeal to them. I’ve even see people who claim that learning some amount of toki pona is a rite of passage in the conlanging community, though I’m not sure I’d agree. For them though, why can’t it be? The reasons for learning toki pona are as diverse as the reasons for learning anything else, with the exception of being as useful as spanish would be to an american who lives on the mexican border to the south.</p>

            <details>
              <summary id="does-anyone-speak-toki-pona">Q - Is there really anyone who speaks toki pona? And where is toki pona spoken?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Yes! According to census data, there were about 1,500 speakers, as of late 2022. I attended a meetup in DC where a dozen or so speakers enjoyed each other’s company and hardly spoke any English the whole time. While it may not be spoken as much as most of the natural languages people are aware of, it is still spoken.</p>
              <p>As for where toki pona is spoken, I've met toki pona speakers from every continent except antarctica. While there are only a handful of IRL toki pona speaking communities, and those communities are very small (a dozen people at most who all live in a much larger city), some hotspots I know of are the Bay Area in California, Seattle, and the Twin Cities for some reason. But I've also been to some of these places, and I live in the Twin Cities, so it makes sense that I would know more toki ponists who live there than anywhere else. If you do some looking, you may be able to find toki ponists in your area too. I met one of my toki pona speaking friends who lives in the Twin Cities at a meetup in chicago. Outside of North America, I am sure that there are some toki pona speaking communities in Western Europe, but elsewhere I'm not sure and I can't really speculate. The more you hang out in online spaces, the more people you'll meet who live near you. But if you're not an adult yet, please be careful before planning to meet up with people you met online. It can be really fun but it can also be dangerous.</p>
              <p>It's 100% true to say that toki pona is almost entirely spoken online, so it's not usually associated with a country, but if it were, that country would probably be Canada, the home country of Sonja Lang, I guess.</p>

          <details><summary>Misconceptions and common misinformed questions</summary>
            <details>
              <summary id="real">Q - Is toki pona a real language?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Yes! In fact, from almost all definitions of a language, toki pona qualifies. Unless you also don’t consider Esperanto and Dothraki languages, the constructed nature of toki pona doesn’t prevent it from being a language. And, unless you don’t consider Ancient Egyptian and Medieval Galician to be languages, toki pona’s lack of native speakers doesn’t prevent it from being a language. (linguistics jargon ahead!!) toki pona fits each and every one of Hockett’s design features of langauge, which linguists around the world use as a basis for the defintion of language. The small vocabulary, while unique, doesn’t prevent it from communicating anything that a communication system needs in order to be considered a language. Even though it has recursion via some analyses, that doesn’t really matter. Despite <em>some linguists</em> beleiving that all language needs embedded recursion, toki pona is able to use soley anaphora to acomplish the same thing, which if anything suggests that the theory of universal grammar needs a rework. toki pona is not a natural language, but it is still a language, and it’s real.</p>

              <summary id="simple-topics">Q - Isn’t impossible to talk about anything that isn’t super simple?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Nope! It does get harder though. Do not base the capabilities of toki pona on your own abilities a week in. If you can’t think of a way to say something, that doesn’t mean there isn’t one. Proficiency isn’t knowing a lot of words—it’s being able to describe a large range of concepts, and that can take months. I learned what a derivative was in toki pona. I’ve witnessed people criticize code written on a walk using only toki pona. Often people will use jargon as a gotcha—can’t describe a higgs boson in toki pona! And while I probably couldn’t do it justice, I’m sure there is a quantum physisit out there who is able to describe it properly. You just gotta know what something is from the ground up. Describing something complex is easy if you turn it into a lot of simple things.</p>

            <br>

            <details>
              <summary id="many-meanings">Q - How do you know which of the many meanings a word means in a particular context?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - toki pona words don’t usually have a lot of meanings. The range of ideas they can refer to, also known as their “semantic space,” is usually a really big set of objects with a few shared traits, just like in other languages. The big difference in toki pona is that those ranges are much bigger. It’s not like each toki pona word has eighteen different seperate meanings. toki pona isn’t like the golden compass from His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman.</p>

            <details>
              <summary id="newspeak">Q - This reminds me of Newspeak from 1984 by George Orwell. Does toki pona limit what you can think about like Newspeak does?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - I personally haven't read the whole book, but I understand what newspeak is, and its goals are completely different from toki pona's. Newspeak was designed to opress by limiting what people are able to think about. This is actually impossible to do anyway, because language cannot limit what you are able to think about. It can only influence what you do end up thinking about. For example, the words you use when talking to someone in Korean change depending on their age, marital status, and other factors, so a Korean speaker will probably remember if you're married better than an english speaker (unless the english speaker needs to call you "Ms." vs "Mrs.") That doesn't mean that English speakers aren't able to think or talk about marriage. Quite the contrary! Some Anglophones won't shut up about it. And that's beautiful.</p>
              <p>toki pona, on the other hand, was designed for fun and exploration! Thinking in toki pona doesn't limit what I'm able to think about. It may limit what you can think about while you're still learning, but that's hardly unique to toki pona. When I think in tok pisin, I can't think about complicated linguistics terms or plant taxonomy. But that's an issue of proficiency, not of the language itself.</p>

              <summary id="depression">Can Toki Pona help me or others with depression or other mental struggles and disabilities?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - This is a pretty common misconception that may be slightly harmful. There is no evidence that toki pona has a positive effect on depression or any other mental illness. Annecdotally, many people have shared that the community helped them with real human connection. Dispite speculation, toki pona has never served sucessfully as an assisted communication tool for mute and nonverbal people. This doesn't mean that toki pona for sure <em>doesn't</em> do any of these things, but there's no reason why it would be uniquely equipped when compared with other hobbies that can bring community to someone. This should go without saying but please seek professional help if you are struggling with depression. toki pona is absolutely not a replacement for modern medicine and should never be treated as such.</p>

            <details>
              <summary id="compounds">Q - If words are often compounded, doesn’t that mean the compounds become new words, and the language has far more than just 120 words?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - If that happened, then yes. Because toki pona is built upon a small vocabulary, speakers want it to stay that way, and avoid creating compounds like this. You can still modify one word with another, but as soon as there’s extra meaning not given by the two words alone or context, it’s become lexicalized. Despite the effort of speakers, this can happen sometimes. Fortunately, it’s pretty rare, and most speakers avoid it. So toki pona still has about 120 words.</p>
            </details>
            <br>

            <details>
              <summary id="simple-island-language">Q - This reminds me of a language simple people would speak on an island, like Hawai’ian.</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Okay let me work quickly here. Calling some cultures simpler than others, no matter the context, is racist. It has been used to justify colonialism. “Look at these simple people! We need to take control of them and their land so we can bring them the joys of Complex European Culture.” If you think this is overly dramatic, it’s not. These are real justifications used by real people, and they are used today. Now that that’s out of the way, similarly to how it’s difficult to put all people on a single sliding scale of general intelligence, it’s very difficult to put all languages on a sliding scale of general complexity. It is possible to compare aspects of languages. For example, toki pona has a less complex inflectional morphology system than English. toki pona has a much smaller lexicon than Vietnamese. toki pona requires more information to be disambiguated via context in order to disambiguate large concepts than Nahuatl. But to say toki pona is <em>generally</em> simpler than other langauges is misguided and not really useful.</p>

              <summary id="pig-latin">Q - Is toki pona a cipher, like pig latin?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Nope! toki pona doesn’t mimic any of English’s grammar. Any similarities are not because it is a cipher. There have been a few games of toki pona telephone where speakers translate a paragraph back and forth between toki pona and english until the paragraph is unrecognizable. This wouldn’t be possible if it was a simple cipher. A toki pona speaker cannot rely on english when speaking toki pona.</p>

            <details>
              <summary id="IAL">Q - Is toki pona meant for everyone in the world to learn it easily, like Esperanto? or: Is toki pona an IAL (international auxiliary language)?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Not quite. Unlike Esperanto, toki pona wasn’t designed explicitly for this purpose. However, part of its design was to be culturally neutral towards natural langauges across the world, something that Esperanto doesn’t really succeed at. toki pona lacks sounds that aren’t abundantly common in natural languages. It lacks complicated cultural customs that exist in any culture associated with natural languages. Its words come from a very interesting set of languages, which do include European languages, but also include languages from outside of Europe. A lot of the vocabulary is recognizable to English speakers. But hypothetically, if given access to the same resources, the advantage being a native English speaker affords is marginal at best and wouldn’t help much. So while toki pona was made primarily for other things, this is something it is good at.</p>

            <br>

            <details>
              <summary id="vague">Q - How do I know what people are talking about if the words are so vague?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - The answer here is a bit complicated and goes into the heart of toki pona’s philosophy. In most languages, there are two methods people use to disambiguate. The first is a large lexicon with lots of words that can mean lots of specific things. English has the word “phonebook” which is very specific. However, you could also use the other method—context—to describe the same thing using only words that are as vague as toki pona words, or close anyway. “A large book filled with numbers. Some of the pages are white, and some of them are yellow. I can use these numbers on the white pages to communicate with other people even when I’m not in the same room using a different tool, the telephone. I can use the numbers on the yellow pages to contact buisnesses.” I’m not sure if everyone reading this knows what a phonebook is, but one thing to note is that if the listener does know what one is, they could probably cut off the speaker at the end of the second sentence. It doesn’t really take that long after all. And if someone doesn’t know what a phonebook is, they’d probably need it to be explained to them anyway. toki pona has a small lexicon to force its speakers to communicate using the second method only—no large lexicon with lots of words that can mean specific things means that speakers have to use context to be understood, which might feel a little weird. It’s one of the reasons why toki pona can take a while to get the hang of, which is unique. This process can slow down how you think and help you analyze what actually needs to be communicated using words in order to get across what you want to get across. It’s not as efficient as natural languages are, but it’s not that much less efficient either.</p>

              <summary id="text-vs-speech">Q - Is speaking toki pona out loud different than communicating by text?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Of course! Because the language varies so much by speaker, the exact way this manifests can change from person to person, and there have been no studies on this, so I don't have any more specific data for toki pona as a whole. As for myself, I tend to be more verbose when speaking out loud.</p>

              <summary id="AI">Q - Can AI help me learn or translate Toki Pona?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Nope! AI is particularly unreliable for toki pona. Especially when there are people online ready to answer all your questions with reliable answers for free, why would you need to use AI? I've seen some people on the subreddit post responses based on AI and said "this is what the AI said," and they're always either at least half gibberish or false/misleading. Join kama sona, a discord server for toki pona learners, or post on the subreddit if you want these questions answered. And chances are they will get answered like immediately.</p>

              <summary id="translating-as-a-beginner">Q - Is attempting to translate some art I like a good first goal in my journey to learn Toki Pona?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - Sure! Trying to translate something is a great way to learn a new language. Make sure to ask for feedback if you're able. You will likely make mistakes. I am not very proud of my first translations, but I'm VERY proud that I tried. Don't get too attached to your early translations and don't be afraid to scrap them. They will probably be very bad, so think of them as a learning tool and not a final product you can publish that others will enjoy profusely. Good luck!</p>

              <summary id="sitelen-pona-at-the-same-time">Q - Should I learn sitelen pona at the same time as I learn everything else about Toki Pona, or should I wait?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - DEFINITELY learn them at the same time! Especially if you're dyslexic like me, being a proficient reader of a logography will be a big confidence boost early on. There is significant scientific evidence that dyslexic people read faster when reading logographies than when reading alphabets. Most proficient speakers I know read sitelen pona, and sitelen pona is really fun and cool! Make sure to experiment with sitelen pona. When I learned toki pona, I actually learned the glyphs and their meanings before learning the words themselves. I think this was particularly useful for me because I could tie the semantic spaces to glyphs before having to tie them to sounds, which made reading them faster.</p>

              <summary id="simplify-thoughts">Q - Will Toki Pona really teach me to simplify my thoughts?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - It might! One of the goals of toki pona is to slow down thinking so you can be aware of what you're really thinking about. Like the classic example of a bad friend. If a friend is a jan pona, then a bad friend is a jan pona ike, which doesn't make sense. So maybe a friend isn't always a jan pona. You HAVE to think about these things in order to communicate effectively in toki pona. Is this method of thinking really more simple than how you normally think? In my opinion, it's just different, not more simple. But who knows!</p>

              <summary id="help-learn-other-language">Q - Will Toki Pona help me learn a different language?</summary>
              <p><strong>A</strong> - There is actually a study on this! Paolo Coluzzi, an Italian professor at Universiti Malaya, conducted a study entitled <em>How learning Toki Pona may help improving communication strategies in a foreign or second language.</em> In it, he has his Italian students try to use circumlocution (talking around things) before and after four toki pona classes. My italian isn't great, but it looks like any effect toki pona had on learning Italian was concentrated specifically in circumlocution. For example, a student who translated "monkeys" as "monkeys" (which is, unsuprisingly, not actually an Italian word) translated it as "molti animali che gli piace mangiare la banana" (which means "many animals that like to eat the banana") after the four lessons. Students were also more likely to use less specific terms when they didn't know the Italian word for something. For example, one student who translated "cherries" as "fragole" (which means "strawberries") and another student who translated it as "ceri" (which is a phonetic transcription in Italian of the English word "cherry" that is plural because it ends in an i) both later translated it as "frute" (which means "fruits"). Circumlocution is an important skill in language learning, and the evidence from this study looks somewhat promising, but it had a sample size of six, which is definitely not many! So we don't really know, but a lot of toki pona speakers have claimed that it has helped them, and I can agree that anecdotally learning toki pona has helped me with circumlocution in my target languages. This is all to say: <strong>we don't know for sure, but anecdotally, some toki pona speakers attribute ease of language aquisition of other languages to having learned toki pona in some aspects.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - Yeah, sure! The resources online for toki pona are some of the best langauge learning resources out there. It's probably because toki pona lends itself very well to many divergent methods of language teaching, which is why it works so well for so many people.</p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - Well, there might be a single word for it! For example, the toki pona word for "defenestrate" is "pana." The toki pona word for "antidisestablishmentarianism" is "nasin." The word for "Eukaryota Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Procyon Lotor" is "soweli" (or in this case, you could also use kijetesantakalu). None of these words are very specific, and definitely not as specific as their english counterparts, but it's really not that hard to elaborate on what makes antidisestablishmentarianism different from other nasin, or that which separates Eukaryota Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Procyon Lotor from other soweli. Sometimes, though, those details aren't relevant to communicate an idea, so toki ponists leave them out!</p>

              <p><strong>A</strong> - tokiponidos are conlangs based off of toki pona. Sometimes a learner or speaker of toki pona will want to tweak the design goals of toki pona, and frequently they'll design a new language that answers the question, "what if toki pona did X instead of Y?" For example, tuki tiki answers "what if toki pona only had 39 words?" luka pona sign language answers "what if toki pona was a singed language?" There aren't really any other notable tokiponidos besides these two, but if you disagree with any of the design choices Sonja Lang made or any of the common ways toki pona is used, consider trying to branch out to tokiponidos. You might enjoy yourself more!</p>

            <p><strong>A</strong> - The way toki pona uses "li" is very similar to how Tok Pisin, the language that the word "li" comes from, uses "i" (which is the word that li comes from). All of tok pisin's first person and second person pronouns don't need an i, and all of toki pona's first person and second person pronouns don't need a li. It's not weird crosslinguistically to use a particle like li in this way, even if it might not make sense from a logical perspective. toki pona isn't that logical in design!</p>

            <summary id="pi-nesting">Q - Can I stack/nest pi?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - When people ask this, what they mean is: is it grammatical to use pi multiple times in the same section of a sentence? And the answer is, yes! For example, "jan pi pana sona pi toki pona" could mean "person of the giving knowledge of toki pona" - toki pona teacher! The follow up question is usually, "how do I know what the second pi is modifying? Is it modifying the first pi phrase, or the original word?" And the answer to that is that usually it's clear from context, and there's no way to know if it's one or the other based on the grammar alone.</p>
            <p>It is also true that most toki pona speakers do this very rarely if at all. At the point you want to make a noun long enough to have two pi phrases in it, you should probably separate that information into a new sentence. It's often easy to misunderstand a stacked or nested pi, so a lot of speakers discourage usage in learners. I personally think that every learner can improve their toki pona by trying to communicate without using pi at all for a little while. I have known toki pona speakers who have gone years without using it, much less stacking it or nesting it.</p>

            <summary id="context">Q - People keep telling me that "context matters." What does that mean?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - The context provided for a sentence is all of the information the receiver of language has access to. There are lots of types of context, but the big ones I've noticed that come up for toki pona are presupposition, situational context, prior knowledge, and other sentences.</p>
            <p>Presuppositions are pieces of information implied by a sentence. For example, I could say "my mother gave birth yesterday!" I'm in my early 20s. First, you can presuppose that I have a mother, that I am in contact with her, and that my mom has been pregnent for the past ~9 months. But you can go deeper. If you have prior knowledge about menopause, you'll know that around a certain age, the uterus is no longer able to harbor children and the overies stop producing. That age is somewhere in the 40s age range. If I'm in my early 20s and my mother was able to give birth yesterday, you can presuppose that she probably gave birth to me when she was in her early twenties, and she is now in her 40s. It's unlikely that she gave birth before she was in her 20s. From that one sentence alone, there is so much information you can logic out. But at a certain point, it becomes speculation. Did she give birth to twins? As people get closer to menopause, they start to release more eggs at a time, making the likelyhood of giving birth to twins higher. That's not a presupposition, that's a speculation. An example of presupposition in toki pona is me saying "jan Aka li toki tawa soweli suwi ona." We can presuppose from this sentence that jan Aka li jo e soweli, and that soweli pi jan Aka li suwi.</p>
            <p>Situational context is all the things, physical or otherwise, that surround a sentence. If I say "ko suwi sina li pona seme?" That could mean a lot of things. But if you're eating ice cream, I'm almost definitely asking about the ice cream and not some other ko suwi. Because sentences have a range of possible meanings, it's important to pay attention to visual, auditory, or other clues from your surroundings. Where are you? Who are you talking to? What words did they say that represent things you can point to? All speakers of all languages end up gesturing towards things they talk about a lot too to make this context abundantly clear. If you're speaking online, this context may not be as accessible, but just the person you're talking to could be information enough. If you don't have any situational context to draw on, though, don't worry! There's plenty of context to go around!</p>
            <p>Prior knowledge is the wealth of information we hold in our minds. It's all of our past experiences, fun facts, skills, and expertese. Often toki pona speakers will learn about what each other know about, and use that as a basis to communicate. If I know that one of my friends has a background in linguistics, I can be more conservative with my description of linguistic concepts because I know at a certain point they'll get what I'm talking about. In English, this manafests as "do you know about ambiguity tests?" But because in toki pona there's no word for these jargon concepts, checking to see what prior knowledge someone has can take a while. Learning how to do this is necessary in order to move on to more advanced conversation topics in toki pona.</p>
            <p>When a speaker doesn't have enough context from the above three types of context, their main tool is to make their own! That's where other sentences come in. If information isn't clear and something in one sentence doesn't make sense, supplement that with another sentence! Let different sentences support each other. The juxtoposition of "My mom just got home!" and "My mom has been at the hospital for a month" leads to far more presuppositions, and therefore more understanding of the meaning. If someone doesn't have all the context, you can just give it to them!</p>

            <summary id="la-nesting">Q - Can I use la multiple times in one sentence? How does that work?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - I recommend using la a lot! You can use it as many times as you want in a row. But I think that thinking about it as all one big sentence can be a bit misleading. When a noun phrase comes before la (such as "tenpo pini la mi moku e pan"), that is one sentence. Stacking these is really easy: "lon la tenpo pini la tomo sina la mi moku e pan." But if an entire sentence comes before it (such as "jan li pona tawa mi la mi pona sama tawa ona"), it's better to think about it as too sentences, with the la showing cause and effect. You can string as many of these together. Don't overthink which la gets embedded inside which sentence like russian dolls. Think of it like a line of dominoes falling down one after another. And you can combine these too! Just remember: if it's a noun phrase, it's part of the sentence that follows it, and if it's an entire sentence, it's like dominoes. People use la like this all the time.</p>
            <p>Two people may sometimes both contribute to a statement, where the first one will say a sentence, and the second one will start their sentence with "la" to evoke cause and effect. Cause and effect is the name of the game with la when it's in between two sentences. It's less common to see la used this way in writing, but you will still see it here and there.</p>

            <p><strong>A</strong> - When it comes to meaning, nope! They do the exact same thing. The only difference is when you can use them. Most speakers only use X ala X in sentences either with a preposition, a preverb, or a predicate that is only one word lon. Some people deviate and use X ala X on either the entire verb phrase or just the first word, but it can be hard to parse and I don't recommend that usage. "anu seme" can be appended to <em>any</em> non-question sentence to make it into a yes/no question without fail.</p>

            <summary id="nimisin">Q - Can I add new words to toki pona?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - You can try. It’s very unlikely anyone will use them. Many people have tried, and especially after 2020, very few words at all have entered common use. If you use your own new words, people will likely be confused. toki pona was completed a while ago. It’s a living language, and it grows organically. <em>Especially</em> as a learner, wouldn’t it be weird to suggest changes to Spanish in Spanish class? Like “what if we didn’t gender anything.” It would be ridiculous. Suggesting a change to toki pona is likewise at the very least a little weird. But it happens. Another thing to consider is: why do you want to add the new word? Is it because you think toki pona needs it? A lot of people have thought this about a lot of concepts, but it’s not ever true. toki pona doesn’t need a new word for think or a new word for context - you can already talk about those concepts with preëxisting words. You probably just don’t know how to yet because you’re still learning, and that’s fine.</p>

            <summary id="rude">Q - Can you be rude in toki pona?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - Yeah. You can degrade someone as much as you can in English. I’d put an example, but I don’t really want to say mean things to the person reading. However, it’s a lot more difficult to be passive agressive about it. Passive agression usually relies on some level of hiddenness in meaning. Because it’s passive, people say one thing and intent something else. This is very difficult to pull off in toki pona, but soweli Nata came up with a good example. If someone’s cooking something, saying “a, ni li tawa soweli mani anu seme?” “oh, is this for a cow or something?” is just a question at face value, but it’s rude because you’re calling someone’s food animal food. There’s a lot of nuance that goes into insults in <em>any</em> language, but some people have said some horrible things to me. You can be rude or violent in toki pona, definitely.</p>

            <summary id="friend">Q - how would I say "friend" in toki pona?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - This is something I've wanted to write about for a while. The concept of a "friend" differs so much across not just different cultures but also across different members of the same culture. What my friends mean to me is different from what I mean to them. A lot of toki ponists have said that a friend is someone who is good, and therefore a good word for friend is "jan pona," but I disagree with the premise here. Friendship is a type of relationship between two people. "jan pona" doesn't describe a relationship, it describes nothing but your perspective of the person you're talking about. A friend can be a jan pona, but "jan pona" does not convey that relationship. For me, saying something like "jan mi" or "jan poka" is much better. This is because these phrases call to mind a specific relationship: my person, or a close person. For me, closeness is the most important part of friendship, so when I'm thinking in toki pona, I break down the concept of "friend" to "jan poka" a lot. If you feel that you'd break it down as "jan pona," please consider what concept you're talking about when you say the english word "friend" and if "jan pona" is really exemplifying that.</p>

            <summary id="think">Q - Why isn't there a word for "think" in toki pona?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - There <em>is</em> a word for think! "toki" is used very consistently by speakers to mean think as well as speak. I know that sounds confusing, but let me explain. the concept of "toki" is broader than the concept of talking. toki is any type of communication, be that internal or external. The only difference between thinking and talking is that with thinking, the recipient is internal, and with talking, the recipient is external. For this reason, it's very common to specify that thinking is internal by modifying "toki" with "insa." But it's not strictly necessary, because the spectrum that thinking and talking share has a lot of gray area. Is thinking out loud talking? Is talking to yourself thinking? Can you think out loud to yourself? Can you talk to yourself without talking? None of these questions permiate toki pona because toki pona uses only one word for all of these concepts. Just explain what is actually going on. When practicing toki pona, try to think about talking and thinking as the same basic idea with more clarified information.</p>

            <summary id="word-for-context">Q - If toki pona is so context heavy, why is there no word for context?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - There are actually <em>more than one</em> word for context! If you want to learn more about what exactly "context" means, scroll up or click <a href="#context">here</a> and translate some of those concepts to figure it out for yourself, but the long and short of it is that context is the information surrounding something. It's the nearby information. The sona poka! Context is very frequently a type of sona, and I feel that context is inherently close to something metaphysically, which is why "poka" works so well as a modifier in this example. You could also use any other word in place of sona. Like if you were talking about a piece of context that was also a dog, you could say "soweli poka." poka, metaphysically, means "relevant," and context is also in my opinion inherently relevant. You can also use "tenpo" to mean "situation," which is very useful for talking about specifically situational context.</p>

            <summary id="opposite">Q - How could I talk about the opposite of something? And couldn't toki pona save on words by having one word for "opposite" and removing half of the words?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - toki pona doesn't need to have a smaller vocabulary, and such a word would take away some of the fun semantic spaces we have. Like how "sinpin" can mean "wall," and "monsi" can mean "ass." An ass is not the opposite of a wall, at least not conceptually, so these words are not opposites even if they can talk about opposite directions. If you want to talk about an opposing direction, monsi can be very useful. For concepts of returning, "sin" is very useful as well. If you want to talk about an opposite meaning, you'll need to do a bit of thinking. The opposite of the "hidden" definition of "len" may very well be something like "jan li ken lukin e ona" or "jan mute li sona e lon ona." It may require a whole sentence like that. And there is no one clear opposite of the cloth meaning of len, so there's nothing to desire there. You can also use "poka" and "ante" to describe opposing sides of something. While it doesn't necesserily mean the opposite side, and may be a different other side, for things like rivers, there are only two sides anyway. These are just some ideas about how you can talk about opposites, but remember: the concept of an opposite is pretty weird and not always as useful as you think! Speaking a language without a word for opposite can pose a very interesting challenge.</p>

I think it works in a pinch but if you don't want to risk it, you can always get by with an incomplete list. "soweli en akesi en waso en ijo ante kin li lon" works for "animals are here," for example. "mi jo e akesi e waso e ijo ante sama" could be "I have lots of pet animals."</p>

            <summary id="lexicalization">Q - What is "lexicalization" and why is it bad?</summary>
            <p>Lexicalization is when a word or phrase becomes a part of the lexicon of a language. A lexicon is the set of all words and phrases with their own meanings in the language. For example, "doorbell" is a lexicalized phrase because its meaning is greater than its parts. It isn't actually always a bell on a door. In fact, in English, we're likely to avoid saying "doorbell" to describe those little bells that some stores put on their doors so that they can hear when people enter and exit <em>because</em> a doorbell is usually a button next to a door that makes a noise when pressed. Another example might be "jew harp," which isn't actually a harp and isn't related to jews or judaism. Keep in mind that a lexicalized phrase doesn't have to be a compound word like "doorbell." Something like "old money" is still a lexicalized phrase because the money itself isn't actually old and "old money" refers to something different than what its parts would mean together.</p>
            <p>In toki pona, speakers avoid lexicalization like the plague for one very important reason among many: lexicalization increases the size of a language's lexicon. toki pona is so awesome <em>because</em> it has such a limited vocabulary. Any lexicalization increases the number of words and phrases in the language. Even though it's made of two words, "anu seme" is a grammaticalized phrase (which is like a lexicalized phrase but for grammatical words) that has a grammatical meaning beyond the normal meaning of its two parts together. This means that for however many words are in toki pona, there is one extra entry in the lexicon tht must be learned.</p>
            <p>Another reason why lexicalizations are avoided in toki pona is because as soon as a word gets lexicalized, it can no longer take on other meanings of a combination of its parts. Think about how "doorbell" can't refer to any bell related to any door without causing confusion. As soon as we lexicalize "sike tu" to mean bycicle, we can no longer use it to describe a turntable without causing confusion.</p>
            <p>To avoid lexicalization, speakers try to talk about concepts from new angles. For example, "tomo tawa" is a common lexicalization for "car" because it was used in Sonja Lang's first official book. In order to avoid increasing the size of the lexicon and cutting off the possible meanings of "tomo tawa," speakers try to use "tomo tawa" to refer to things that <em>aren't</em> cars and try to use other phrases <em>for</em> cars, like calling a house during an earthquake a tomo tawa and calling a car an ilo tawa (or even something creative and a little rediculous, like "soweli!").</p>
            <p>I'm not going to list common lexicalizations here because I think the people who use them are at some level aware of what they're doing. I'm sure that you can figure out when a phrase you're using is becoming lexicalized and take action to prevent that from happening. It's also important to mention that lexicalization is not the same as reusing a phrase to refer to the same thing in a single conversation because it doesn't add a word to the lexicon, it just ties concepts together as a type of context.</p>

            <summary id="calque">Q - What is a "calque" and why is it bad?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - In a general sense of all languages, a calque is an idiomatic phrase in a language that is a literal translation of an idiomatic phrase from another language. "Idiomatic" just means that something doesn't make sense when translated literally into every language, such as idiom or an idiomtic expression, like "Oh they've got my goat!" or "out of the frying pan and into the fire." An example of a calque in a natural language would be "pequeno almoço" in portuguese, which literally translates to "little lunch," but actually means "breakfast." This comes directly from "petit-déjeuner" in French, which also directly translates to "little lunch" but actually means "breakfast." The Portuguese "pequeno almoço" is only considered a calque because it comes from a direct translation of a phrase in a different language.</p>
            <p>Calques in toki pona are usually discouraged because they cannot be lexicalized <a href="#lexicalization">(click here if you don't know what that means)</a>. Let's look at an example of what I'm talking about with English and Tok Pisin. If I said "This place is an easy belly" and you didn't speak Tok Pisin, you would have no idea what I meant. In reality, this phrase in Tok Pisin (dispela hap i bel isi) would mean "this place is calm and peaceful." Because this calque isn't lexicalized in English, it isn't understandable. Any time someone calques in toki pona, unless the phrase already makes sense in toki pona without an outside perspective, it will not be understood as intended because lexicalized phrases do not occur most of the time.</p>
            <p>Some common examples of calques that come up with native English speaking toki pona learners are:</p>

              <li id="tenpo-monsi-before-tenpo-sinpin-after"><p><strong>"tenpo monsi" for "before" and "tenpo sinpin" for "after."</strong> English has a conceptual metaphor that puts time on a line that we walk forward along, which we can see in phrases like "let's move <strong>forward</strong> with this" and "I looked <strong>back</strong> to my past." Many languages have different conceptual metaphors with time in which people walk backwards through time, facing their past, not their future. toki pona doesn't have either conceptual metaphor, so neither "tenpo monsi" nor "tenpo sinpin" are used for "before" <em>or</em> "after."</p></li>
              <li id="kalama-sewi-anpa-high-low-pitch"><p><strong>"kalama sewi" for high pitches and "kalama anpa" for low pitches.</strong> English has a conceptual metaphor that places pitches in order from top to bottom. It runs so deeply in English that speakers of English can't talk about pitches without using words that also talk about height (try it! you will fail!). Turkish, in contrast, treats lower notes as "thick" and higher notes as "thin," so a Turkish toki pona speaker would have no idea what this meant! While it is true that for the human voice, lower notes can resonate lower in the body than higher notes, you can also sing lying down on the floor or upside down (and people do these things, especially in opera), not to mention that you can sing very low and control the resonance so that the note resonates in your head, and the opposite is also possible. My solution for this is usually to compare voices to the sounds made by soweli and waso, because waso are usually smaller than soweli and it's definitely not a calque of English. You could use "soweli lili" and "soweli suli" as tools here if you're worried about large birds and small mammals, but large birds are often flightless, and I don't use waso to describe flightless birds, so this is a moot point for me. "sama" is very useful here either way.</p></li>
              <li id="calque-pali"><p><strong>"pali" for "do."</strong> This for sure isn't always a calque, but the word "do" is used a lot in English for things that aren't the same concept in toki pona. "I'm doing homework" could be "mi pali lipu" because homework is work, but "I'm doing dishes" couldn't be "mi pali e ilo moku" because that reads as "I am making dishes". Likewise, "mi pali e supa lape" means "I'm creating a bed," not "I'm making a bed." I would use nasin or pona instead of pali there. Any time you see yourself using "pali" for something you'd use "do" for in English, reconsider if what you're describing is actually a type of work or a type of making something.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>"lukin" for "to look like."</strong> This calque is influenced a lot by how "lukin" sounds like the english word "looking." You may see learners of toki pona say things like "mi lukin sama soweli." This doesn't mean "I look like a dog." This means "I see like a dog." English uses the words "look" and "like" to mean "appear as," but toki pona doesn't.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>"esun" for "spending time."</strong> Another conceptual metaphor in English is "time is money." This shows up all over the way we talk about things. "I'm saving time." "I spent my time in France." "I'll buy us some time." Note how the words "save," "spend," and "buy" are all used for both time and money. This conceptual metaphor is baked into our lexicon. So even though these phrases make sense in English, "mi esun e tenpo" doesn't mean "I'm buying us some time." In fact, it probably refers to switching dates on a calendar, because toki pona has a conceptual metaphor where buying and selling are acts of swapping.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you can tell, a lot of calques in toki pona arise from a speaker's ignorance towards the conceptual metaphors in their mother tongue. This is for sure something to think about!</p>
            <p>One more thing to keep in mind: just because it is phrased like something in a different language doesn't mean it doesn't work natively in toki pona. For example, "I'm under the covers" can be "mi lon anpa len" because toki pona has the same conceputal metaphor as English in which it uses the same words for "hidden" to refer to types of cloths. This is by coincidence, and if a proficient speaker uses len like this, they aren't calquing English, they're just speaking toki pona.But my list isn't exhaustive, and you will be able to spot calques I didn't mention. If you think a calque is common enough for me to include here, feel free to let me know and i probably will!</p>

            <summary id="open-pini-preverbs">Q - Are "open" and "pini" preverbs?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - Yeah kind of. I hardly ever see them in the wild, but a large portion of speakers consider themselves users of open and pini preverbs. The concepts of starting and stopping things may not come up that often, and for most speakers there are other ways of saying these concepts that feel more natural, like by using the preverb "kama" or by rephrasing it so that open and pini are a normal verb instead of a preverb. In reality, we don't have any reliable data on usage of these preverbs at the moment. I'm working on a paper on this and I've collected data with a somewhat large sample size (it's looking to be over 125), and once I publish the paper I will provide more accurate information here.</p>
            <p>I personally don't recommend using these words as preverbs because thinking about the concepts of starting and stopping and looking at how these manifest in the natural world is so much more interesting that using a preverb for it. Like what does it mean to start writing a book? The act of beginning to write a book may look like setting up a typewriter, or opening a document on a computer. Lots of things to think about!</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Names can be a very important part of any language, so this section explores how names work in toki pona.</summary>
          <details>
            <summary id="how-do-names-work">Q - How do names work in toki pona?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - There are a few ways to do names, and here are the most common ones: tokiponization, calquing, or making up a new name. I'll go over all three methods here.</p>
            <p><strong>tokiponization</strong> is the process of taking a word from a different language and changing the way it sounds to fit the rules of toki pona pronunciation. The exact way of doing this can differ a bit from person to person, but Sonja Lang wrote <a href="https://jan-ne.github.io/tp/tpize">these guidelines</a> that are very commonplace. After loaning a word into toki pona like this, we capitalize it and put it after a different word, depending on what kind of thing it is. If the thing with a name is a type of kili, we put the name directly after "kili." These tokiponized names are often called "proper adjectives" because they only ever serve as adjectives and can't be used on their own. The one exception to this rule is in a sentence with the word "nimi" in it. Things like "nimi mi li San" (my name is San) and "nimi la ona li Atawan" (namewise they are Atawan) are both common and grammatical, but they only work because the word "nimi" shows up in the sentence to show that the loanword is acting as a name. Note that nothing I've said here is a hard and fast rule. You WILL find people who use tokiponized names and don't follow all these rules (such as jan Deni, who uses a D in their name despite toki pona not allowing D, lipamanka (me) who doesn't capitalize my name or give it a head noun, or people who don't have a specified <a href="#headnoun">headnoun</a> and have people just use whatever).</p>
            <p>Note that tokiponization is not limited to the names of people. Languages, places, vehichles, or anything else with a name can spoken about in toki pona using a tokiponized name. Just make sure that you're tokiponizing the word that the members of a group related to the concept use to describe themselves (an endonym), rather than a word used by a different group (exonym). This is really important because it keeps toki pona equally acessible to speakers of all languages and all groups, and it can also help increase your knowledge of what groups of people call themselves. I recommend trying to find indigenous names for places and tokiponizing those, and using them instead of whatever a colonizer named the place. Like I call Minnesota "ma Min Sota Masoke" and New York "ma poka pi ma Mana Ata" which are both based off of the indigenous names of those locations.</p>
            <p><strong>Calquing</strong> for a name is different than calquing in general. Calquing is usually bad in toki pona (see <a href="#calque">here</a> to learn more), but for names, it's fine! A calqued name is simple: If your name in a different language has a meaning, translate the meaning into toki pona words instead of transliterating the sounds into toki pona sounds. If someone's name is "April," their toki pona name could be "tenpo mun," and that's pretty fucking cool. If someone's username on an online chatroom website is "MathLizard," their toki pona name could be "akesi nanpa." This is my personal favorite way of doing names in toki pona. It's really cool!</p>
            <p><strong>Making up a new name.</strong> This one is exactly what it sounds like. Take either of the two methods above, but instead of taking sounds or meaning from somewhere else, just come up with entirely new ones! Wanna try out being "ko"? Go for it, that can be your name. You are now a semisolid and that's really cool. What about "jan Akapelijanela"? I just made up those syllables like right now and that's really cool too. (Though consider making it shorter so others can remember it more easily.)</p>
            <p><strong>REMEMBER:</strong> these methods are not exhaustive. There are other ways to do names! You can also abstain from making a toki pona name! Just continue to use a name from a different language. "Charles li pona mute." This is totally fine if it's what you want to do.</p>

            <summary id="meli-Sonko">Q - Can I use the name of a place as an adjective to mean "of that place"? For example, can I say "supa Juwese" for a table manufactured in the United States?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - This question is debated somewhat among tokiponists, but the consensus I've observed among proficient speakers is that you can't. Proper names are just names, and "Juwese" doesn't mean "the United States of America," it's just a name. "supa Juwese" reads as a table that is named Juwese, not a table from the united states. This whole question is usually refered to as "meli Sonko," which references how lipu pu translates "Chinese woman" as "meli Sonko." "Sonko" is a tokiponization of Zhōngguó, which is an endonym for China. In most speakers's modern usage, this would mean "a woman named Sonko," not "a woman from a place named Sonko." However, there are a handful speakers who use proper names in the <em>meli sonko</em> style out there.</p>

            <summary id="headnoun">Q - What is a "headnoun" and how do I choose mine?</summary>
            <p><strong>A</strong> - A "headnoun" is, in the context of names, the word that comes before a name in toki pona. What something is will change what head noun you use for it. For a pet bird, "waso" is the most apt headnoun. For a country, "ma" is the most apt headnoun. But you are your own being and you have the choice to decide what you are and what word you want to use to represent that. toki pona gives you an opprotunity to experiment with your identity in a really silly way. You can use language to redefine what you are! It's great! For people, the most common head noun is definitely "jan," but you can use any word that isn't a grammatical particle as a head noun.</p>
