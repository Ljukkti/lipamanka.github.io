      <summary><p>There are a lot of misconseptions about toki pona, from what it is, to what it is capable of, to what it's for. The philosophy of the language runs deep, and I hope to answer some questions about it here.</p></summary>

          <summary><h3 id="1">Q - Can you learn toki pona in just a month? Two weeks? A few days? 30 hours? Three hours?</h3></summary>
          <p><strong>A</strong> - It’s possible to get conversational very fast. It took me about three days to get through the whole vocabulary, though it took me a couple of months to refine that, and it took me years to feel their semantic spaces like I feel English’s. If you want to learn toki pona because you think it’ll be faster than other languages, there may be some truth to that, but think about what you want to get out of learning a language. Community? Philosophy? A new outlook on life? To prove a point? To know what it’s like? Because the language you want to learn was taken from you generations ago? Because the language seems interesting? There are so many reasons to want to learn a language, and all of these reasons have motivated me to learn a language, be that Portuguese, Yiddish, or toki pona. toki pona isn’t a thing you can learn in a day, but you can still learn part of it in a day. It’s a journey, and the journey for learning toki pona is unique and unlike any other language I’ve encountered. Every bit of practice helps you learn, but all in all I wouldn’t claim proficiency for at least a month and I would be wary about claiming fluency until six months in.</p>

          <summary><h3 id="2">Q - Is toki pona a real language?</h3></summary>
          <p><strong>A</strong> - Yes! In fact, from almost all definitions of a language, toki pona qualifies. Unless you also don’t consider Esperanto and Dothraki languages, the constructed nature of toki pona doesn’t prevent it from being a language. And, unless you don’t consider Ancient Egyptian and Medieval Galician to be languages, toki pona’s lack of native speakers doesn’t prevent it from being a language. (linguistics jargon ahead!!) toki pona fits each and every one of Hockett’s design features of langauge, which linguists around the world use as a basis for the defintion of language. The small vocabulary, while unique, doesn’t prevent it from communicating anything that a communication system needs in order to be considered a language. Even though it has recursion via some analyses, that doesn’t really matter. Despite <em>some linguists</em> beleiving that all language needs embedded recursion, toki pona is able to use soley anaphora to acomplish the same thing, which if anything suggests that the theory of universal grammar needs a rework. toki pona is not a natural language, but it is still a language, and it’s real.</p>

          <summary><h3 id="3">Q - Is toki pona a cipher, like pig latin?</h3></summary>
          <p><strong>A</strong> - Nope! toki pona doesn’t mimic any of English’s grammar. Any similarities are not because it is a cipher. There have been a few games of toki pona telephone where speakers translate a paragraph back and forth between toki pona and english until the paragraph is unrecognizable. This wouldn’t be possible if it was a simple cipher. A toki pona speaker cannot rely on english when speaking toki pona.</p>

          <summary><h3 id="4">Q - Why would anyone want to learn toki pona?</h3></summary>
          <p><strong>A</strong> - Why would anyone learn how to play a banjo recreationally? Not everything we have to do needs to be useful, so why would that be the same for language learning? Some people do it for fun. For others, the philosophy and design goals of the langauge appeal to them. I’ve even see people who claim that learning some amount of toki pona is a rite of passage in the conlanging community, though I’m not sure I’d agree. For them though, why can’t it be? The reasons for learning toki pona are as diverse as the reasons for learning anything else, with the exception of being as useful as spanish would be to an american who lives on the mexican border to the south.</p>
        </details>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="5">Q - Isn’t impossible to talk about anything that isn’t super simple?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Nope! It does get harder though. Do not base the capabilities of toki pona on your own abilities a week in. If you can’t think of a way to say something, that doesn’t mean there isn’t one. Proficiency isn’t knowing a lot of words—it’s being able to describe a large range of concepts, and that can take months. I learned what a derivative was in toki pona. I’ve witnessed people criticize code written on a walk using only toki pona. Often people will use jargon as a gotcha—can’t describe a higgs boson in toki pona! And while I probably couldn’t do it justice, I’m sure there is a quantum physisit out there who is able to describe it properly. You just gotta know what something is from the ground up. Describing something complex is easy if you turn it into a lot of simple things.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="6">Q - This reminds me of a language simple people would speak on an island, like Hawai’ian.</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Okay let me work quickly here. Calling some cultures simpler than others, no matter the context, is racist. It has been used to justify colonialism. “Look at these simple people! We need to take control of them and their land so we can bring them the joys of Complex European Culture.” If you think this is overly dramatic, it’s not. These are real justifications used by real people, and they are used today. Now that that’s out of the way, similarly to how it’s difficult to put all people on a single sliding scale of general intelligence, it’s very difficult to put all languages on a sliding scale of general complexity. It is possible to compare aspects of languages. For example, toki pona has a less complex inflectional morphology system than English. toki pona has a much smaller lexicon than Vietnamese. toki pona requires more information to be disambiguated via context in order to disambiguate large concepts than Nahuatl. But to say toki pona is <em>generally</em> simpler than other langauges is misguided and not really useful.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="7">Q - Is there really anyone who speaks toki pona?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Yes! According to census data, there were about 1,500 speakers, as of late 2022. I attended a meetup in DC where a dozen or so speakers enjoyed each other’s company and hardly spoke any English the whole time. While it may not be spoken as much as most of the natural languages people are aware of, it is still spoken.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="8">Q - Is toki pona meant for everyone in the world to learn it easily, like Esperanto? or: Is toki pona an IAL (international auxiliary language)?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Not quite. Unlike Esperanto, toki pona wasn’t designed explicitly for this purpose. However, part of its design was to be culturally neutral towards natural langauges across the world, something that Esperanto doesn’t really succeed at. toki pona lacks sounds that aren’t abundantly common in natural languages. It lacks complicated cultural customs that exist in any culture associated with natural languages. Its words come from a very interesting set of languages, which do include European languages, but also include languages from outside of Europe. A lot of the vocabulary is recognizable to English speakers. But hypothetically, if given access to the same resources, the advantage being a native English speaker affords is marginal at best and wouldn’t help much. So while toki pona was made primarily for other things, this is something it is good at.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="9">Q - Can I add new words to toki pona?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - You can try. It’s very unlikely anyone will use them. Many people have tried, and especially after 2020, very few words at all have entered common use. If you use your own new words, people will likely be confused. toki pona was completed a while ago. It’s a living language, and it grows organically. <em>Especially</em> as a learner, wouldn’t it be weird to suggest changes to Spanish in Spanish class? Like “what if we didn’t gender anything.” It would be ridiculous. Suggesting a change to toki pona is likewise at the very least a little weird. But it happens. Another thing to consider is: why do you want to add the new word? Is it because you think toki pona needs it? A lot of people have thought this about a lot of concepts, but it’s not ever true. toki pona doesn’t need a new word for think or a new word for context - you can already talk about those concepts with preëxisting words. You probably just don’t know how to yet because you’re still learning, and that’s fine.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="10">Q - How do you know which of the many meanings a word means in a particular context?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - toki pona words don’t usually have a lot of meanings. The range of ideas they can refer to, also known as their “semantic space,” is usually a really big set of objects with a few shared traits, just like in other languages. The big difference in toki pona is that those ranges are much bigger. It’s not like each toki pona word has eighteen different seperate meanings. toki pona isn’t like the golden compass from His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="11">Q - How do I know what people are talking about if the words are so vague?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - The answer here is a bit complicated and goes into the heart of toki pona’s philosophy. In most languages, there are two methods people use to disambiguate. The first is a large lexicon with lots of words that can mean lots of specific things. English has the word “phonebook” which is very specific. However, you could also use the other method—context—to describe the same thing using only words that are as vague as toki pona words, or close anyway. “A large book filled with numbers. Some of the pages are white, and some of them are yellow. I can use these numbers on the white pages to communicate with other people even when I’m not in the same room using a different tool, the telephone. I can use the numbers on the yellow pages to contact buisnesses.” I’m not sure if everyone reading this knows what a phonebook is, but one thing to note is that if the listener does know what one is, they could probably cut off the speaker at the end of the second sentence. It doesn’t really take that long after all. And if someone doesn’t know what a phonebook is, they’d probably need it to be explained to them anyway. toki pona has a small lexicon to force its speakers to communicate using the second method only—no large lexicon with lots of words that can mean specific things means that speakers have to use context to be understood, which might feel a little weird. It’s one of the reasons why toki pona can take a while to get the hang of, which is unique. This process can slow down how you think and help you analyze what actually needs to be communicated using words in order to get across what you want to get across. It’s not as efficient as natural languages are, but it’s not that much less efficient either.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="12">Q - Can you be rude in toki pona?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Yeah. You can degrade someone as much as you can in English. I’d put an example, but I don’t really want to say mean things to the person reading. However, it’s a lot more difficult to be passive agressive about it. Passive agression usually relies on some level of hiddenness in meaning. Because it’s passive, people say one thing and intent something else. This is very difficult to pull off in toki pona, but soweli Nata came up with a good example. If someone’s cooking something, saying “a, ni li tawa soweli mani anu seme?” “oh, is this for a cow or something?” is just a question at face value, but it’s rude because you’re calling someone’s food animal food. There’s a lot of nuance that goes into insults in <em>any</em> language, but some people have said some horrible things to me. You can be rude or violent in toki pona, definitely.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="13">Q - How many words does toki pona have?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Like, around 120. Some people get mad at this number. There are a lot of words out there, and a lot of them are in use. In the official toki pona dictionary, toki pona is shown to have 137 "essential" words and an additional few dozen words that are not as important to the language. But in my time speaking toki pona, I hardly ever see a conversation where more than one of these additional words beyond the 120 are used. To be fair, this is also the case for a set of the original 120, but the 120 are unambiguously part of almost all speakers’ vocabularies. I usually say “around 120 words” because without this nuance, any other number would be a little misleading and raise a lot of questions. 137 is a really specific number and isn’t particularly accurate. “About 200” is way too high of an estimate, because most speakers and conversations never even come close to reaching that threshold.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="14">Q - If words are often compounded, doesn’t that mean the compounds become new words, and the language has far more than just 120 words?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - If that happened, then yes. Because toki pona is built upon a small vocabulary, speakers want it to stay that way, and avoid creating compounds like this. You can still modify one word with another, but as soon as there’s extra meaning not given by the two words alone or context, it’s become lexicalized. Despite the effort of speakers, this can happen sometimes. Fortunately, it’s pretty rare, and most speakers avoid it. So toki pona still has about 120 words.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="15">Q - This reminds me of Newspeak from 1984 by George Orwell. Does toki pona limit what you can think about like Newspeak does?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - I personally haven't read the whole book, but I understand what newspeak is, and its goals are completely different from toki pona's. Newspeak was designed to opress by limiting what people are able to think about. This is actually impossible to do anyway, because language cannot limit what you are able to think about. It can only influence what you do end up thinking about. For example, the words you use when talking to someone in Korean change depending on their age, marital status, and other factors, so a Korean speaker will probably remember if you're married better than an english speaker (unless the english speaker needs to call you "Ms." vs "Mrs.") That doesn't mean that English speakers aren't able to think or talk about marriage. Quite the contrary! Some Anglophones won't shut up about it. And that's beautiful.</p>
        <p>toki pona, on the other hand, was designed for fun and exploration! Thinking in toki pona doesn't limit what I'm able to think about. It may limit what you can think about while you're still learning, but that's hardly unique to toki pona. When I think in tok pisin, I can't think about complicated linguistics terms or plant taxonomy. But that's an issue of proficiency, not of the language itself.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="16">Q - Is speaking toki pona out loud different than communicating by text?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Of course! Because the language varies so much by speaker, the exact way this manifests can change from person to person, and there have been no studies on this, so I don't have any more specific data for toki pona as a whole. As for myself, I tend to be more verbose when speaking out loud.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="17">Q - Can AI help me learn or translate Toki Pona?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Nope! AI is particularly unreliable for toki pona. Especially when there are people online ready to answer all your questions with reliable answers for free, why would you need to use AI? I've seen some people on the subreddit post responses based on AI and said "this is what the AI said," and they're always either at least half gibberish or false/misleading. Join kama sona, a discord server for toki pona learners, or post on the subreddit if you want these questions answered. And chances are they will get answered like immediately.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="18">Q - Is attempting to translate some art I like a good first goal in my journey to learn Toki Pona?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Sure! Trying to translate something is a great way to learn a new language. Make sure to ask for feedback if you're able. You will likely make mistakes. I am not very proud of my first translations, but I'm VERY proud that I tried. Don't get too attached to your early translations and don't be afraid to scrap them. They will probably be very bad, so think of them as a learning tool and not a final product you can publish that others will enjoy profusely. Good luck!</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="19">Q - Should I learn sitelen pona at the same time as I learn everything else about Toki Pona, or should I wait?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - DEFINITELY learn them at the same time! Especially if you're dyslexic like me, being a proficient reader of a logography will be a big confidence boost early on. There is significant scientific evidence that dyslexic people read faster when reading logographies than when reading alphabets. Most proficient speakers I know read sitelen pona, and sitelen pona is really fun and cool! Make sure to experiment with sitelen pona. When I learned toki pona, I actually learned the glyphs and their meanings before learning the words themselves. I think this was particularly useful for me because I could tie the semantic spaces to glyphs before having to tie them to sounds, which made reading them faster.</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="20">Q - Will Toki Pona really teach me to simplify my thoughts?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - It might! One of the goals of toki pona is to slow down thinking so you can be aware of what you're really thinking about. Like the classic example of a bad friend. If a friend is a jan pona, then a bad friend is a jan pona ike, which doesn't make sense. So maybe a friend isn't always a jan pona. You HAVE to think about these things in order to communicate effectively in toki pona. Is this method of thinking really more simple than how you normally think? In my opinion, it's just different, not more simple. But who knows!</p>
        <!--br-->

        <h3 id="21">Q - Will Toki Pona help me learn a different language?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - There is actually a study on this! Paolo Coluzzi, an Italian professor at Universiti Malaya, conducted a study entitled <em>How learning Toki Pona may help improving communication strategies in a foreign or second language.</em> In it, he has his Italian students try to use circumlocution (talking around things) before and after four toki pona classes. My italian isn't great, but it looks like any effect toki pona had on learning Italian was concentrated specifically in circumlocution. For example, a student who translated "monkeys" as "monkeys" (which is, unsuprisingly, not actually an Italian word) translated it as "molti animali che gli piace mangiare la banana" (which means "many animals that like to eat the banana") after the four lessons. Students were also more likely to use less specific terms when they didn't know the Italian word for something. For example, one student who translated "cherries" as "fragole" (which means "strawberries") and another student who translated it as "ceri" (which is a phonetic transcription in Italian of the English word "cherry" that is plural because it ends in an i) both later translated it as "frute" (which means "fruits"). Circumlocution is an important skill in language learning, and the evidence from this study looks somewhat promising, but it had a sample size of six, which is definitely not many! So we don't really know, but a lot of toki pona speakers have claimed that it has helped them, and I can agree that anecdotally learning toki pona has helped me with circumlocution in my target languages. This is all to say: <strong>we don't know for sure, but anecdotally, some toki pona speakers attribute ease of language aquisition of other languages to having learned toki pona in some aspects.</strong></p>

        <h3 id="22">Can Toki Pona help me or others with depression or other mental struggles and disabilities?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - This is a pretty common misconception that may be slightly harmful. There is no evidence that toki pona has a positive effect on depression or any other mental illness. Annecdotally, many people have shared that the community helped them with real human connection. Dispite speculation, toki pona has never served sucessfully as an assisted communication tool for mute and nonverbal people. This doesn't mean that toki pona for sure <em>doesn't</em> do any of these things, but there's no reason why it would be uniquely equipped when compared with other hobbies that can bring community to someone. This should go without saying but please seek professional help if you are struggling with depression. toki pona is absolutely not a replacement for modern medicine and should never be treated as such.</p>

        <h3 id="23">Q - This is my first time learning a new language. is toki pona a good choice?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Yeah, sure! The resources online for toki pona are some of the best langauge learning resources out there. It's probably because toki pona lends itself very well to many divergent methods of language teaching, which is why it works so well for so many people.</p>

        <h3 id="24">Q - But how do you say [insert complicated word here]?</h3>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - Well, there might be a single word for it! For example, the toki pona word for "defenestrate" is "pana." The toki pona word for "antidisestablishmentarianism" is "nasin." The word for "Eukaryota Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Procyon Lotor" is "soweli" (or in this case, you could also use kijetesantakalu). None of these words are very specific, and definitely not as specific as their english counterparts, but it's really not that hard to elaborate on what makes antidisestablishmentarianism different from other nasin, or that which separates Eukaryota Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Procyon Lotor from other soweli. Sometimes, though, those details aren't relevant to communicate an idea, so toki ponists leave them out!</p>

  <h2 id="grammar">Grammar and conversation</h2>
    <p>This section includes common questions about the grammar of the language, and how to have a conversation in the language.</p>
    <div>
      <h3 id="a">Q - Why can't I use "li" when the subject is "mi" or "sina"?</h3>
      <p><strong>A</strong> - The way toki pona uses "li" is very similar to how Tok Pisin, the language that the word "li" comes from, uses "i" (which is the word that li comes from). All of tok pisin's first person and second person pronouns don't need an i, and all of toki pona's first person and second person pronouns don't need a li. It's not weird crosslinguistically to use a particle like li in this way, even if it might not make sense from a logical perspective. toki pona isn't that logical in design!</p>

      <h3 id="pi">Q - Can I stack/nest pi?</h3>
      <p><strong>A</strong> - When people ask this, what they mean is: is it grammatical to use pi multiple times in the same section of a sentence? And the answer is, yes! For example, "jan pi pana sona pi toki pona" could mean "person of the giving knowledge of toki pona" - toki pona teacher! The follow up question is usually, "how do I know what the second pi is modifying? Is it modifying the first pi phrase, or the original word?" And the answer to that is that usually it's clear from context, and there's no way to know if it's one or the other based on the grammar alone.</p>
      <p>It is also true that most toki pona speakers do this very rarely if at all. At the point you want to make a noun long enough to have two pi phrases in it, you should probably separate that information into a new sentence. It's often easy to misunderstand a stacked or nested pi, so a lot of speakers discourage usage in learners. I personally think that every learner can improve their toki pona by trying to communicate without using pi at all for a little while. I have known toki pona speakers who have gone years without using it, much less stacking it or nesting it.</p>

      <h3 id="context">Q - People keep telling me that "context matters." What does that mean?</h3>
      <p><strong>A</strong> - The context provided for a sentence is all of the information the receiver of language has access to. There are lots of types of context, but the big ones I've noticed that come up for toki pona are presupposition, situational context, prior knowledge, and other sentences.</p>
      <p>Presuppositions are pieces of information implied by a sentence. For example, I could say "my mother gave birth yesterday!" I'm in my early 20s. First, you can presuppose that I have a mother, that I am in contact with her, and that my mom has been pregnent for the past ~9 months. But you can go deeper. If you have prior knowledge about menopause, you'll know that around a certain age, the uterus is no longer able to harbor children and the overies stop producing. That age is somewhere in the 40s age range. If I'm in my early 20s and my mother was able to give birth yesterday, you can presuppose that she probably gave birth to me when she was in her early twenties, and she is now in her 40s. It's unlikely that she gave birth before she was in her 20s. From that one sentence alone, there is so much information you can logic out. But at a certain point, it becomes speculation. Did she give birth to twins? As people get closer to menopause, they start to release more eggs at a time, making the likelyhood of giving birth to twins higher. That's not a presupposition, that's a speculation. An example of presupposition in toki pona is me saying "jan Aka li toki tawa soweli suwi ona." We can presuppose from this sentence that jan Aka li jo e soweli, and that soweli pi jan Aka li suwi.</p>
      <p>Situational context is all the things, physical or otherwise, that surround a sentence. If I say "ko suwi sina li pona seme?" That could mean a lot of things. But if you're eating ice cream, I'm almost definitely asking about the ice cream and not some other ko suwi. Because sentences have a range of possible meanings, it's important to pay attention to visual, auditory, or other clues from your surroundings. Where are you? Who are you talking to? What words did they say that represent things you can point to? All speakers of all languages end up gesturing towards things they talk about a lot too to make this context abundantly clear. If you're speaking online, this context may not be as accessible, but just the person you're talking to could be information enough. If you don't have any situational context to draw on, though, don't worry! There's plenty of context to go around!</p>
      <p>Prior knowledge is the wealth of information we hold in our minds. It's all of our past experiences, fun facts, skills, and expertese. Often toki pona speakers will learn about what each other know about, and use that as a basis to communicate. If I know that one of my friends has a background in linguistics, I can be more conservative with my description of linguistic concepts because I know at a certain point they'll get what I'm talking about. In English, this manafests as "do you know about ambiguity tests?" But because in toki pona there's no word for these jargon concepts, checking to see what prior knowledge someone has can take a while. Learning how to do this is necessary in order to move on to more advanced conversation topics in toki pona.</p>
      <p>When a speaker doesn't have enough context from the above three types of context, their main tool is to make their own! That's where other sentences come in. If information isn't clear and something in one sentence doesn't make sense, supplement that with another sentence! Let different sentences support each other. The juxtoposition of "My mom just got home!" and "My mom has been at the hospital for a month" leads to far more presuppositions, and therefore more understanding of the meaning. If someone doesn't have all the context, you can just give it to them!</p>

  <h2 id="lexicon">Lexicon</h2>
    <p>The lexicon of a language is all of the words in that language. For this section, I'll be going over common questions concerning the lexicon of toki pona, as well as questions related to the most common ideas and concepts I see learners asking about.</p>
    <div>
      <h3 id="friend">Q - how would I say "friend" in toki pona?</h3>
      <p><strong>A</strong> - This is something I've wanted to write about for a while. The concept of a "friend" differs so much across not just different cultures but also across different members of the same culture. What my friends mean to me is different from what I mean to them. A lot of toki ponists have said that a friend is someone who is good, and therefore a good word for friend is "jan pona," but I disagree with the premise here. Friendship is a type of relationship between two people. "jan pona" doesn't describe a relationship, it describes nothing but your perspective of the person you're talking about. A friend can be a jan pona, but "jan pona" does not convey that relationship. For me, saying something like "jan mi" or "jan poka" is much better. This is because these phrases call to mind a specific relationship: my person, or a close person. For me, closeness is the most important part of friendship, so when I'm thinking in toki pona, I break down the concept of "friend" to "jan poka" a lot. If you feel that you'd break it down as "jan pona," please consider what concept you're talking about when you say the english word "friend" and if "jan pona" is really exemplifying that.</p>
      <h3 id="left-right">Q - why are there no words for left and right?</h3>
      <p><strong>A</strong> - I wrote an article about this! Go read it if you're curious! <a href="/essays/direction">Click here.</a></p>
      <h3 id="think">Q - Why isn't there a word for "think" in toki pona?</h3>
      <p><strong>A</strong> - There <em>is</em> a word for think! "toki" is used very consistently by speakers to mean think as well as speak. I know that sounds confusing, but let me explain. the concept of "toki" is broader than the concept of talking. toki is any type of communication, be that internal or external. The only difference between thinking and talking is that with thinking, the recipient is internal, and with talking, the recipient is external. For this reason, it's very common to specify that thinking is internal by modifying "toki" with "insa." But it's not strictly necessary, because the spectrum that thinking and talking share has a lot of gray area. Is thinking out loud talking? Is talking to yourself thinking? Can you think out loud to yourself? Can you talk to yourself without talking? None of these questions permiate toki pona because toki pona uses only one word for all of these concepts. Just explain what is actually going on. When practicing toki pona, try to think about talking and thinking as the same basic idea with more clarified information.</p>
      <h3 id="word-for-context">Q - If toki pona is so context heavy, why is there no word for context?</h3>
      <p><strong>A</strong> - There is actually <em>more than one</em> word for context! If you want to learn more about what exactly "context" means, scroll up or click <a href="#context">here</a> and translate some of those concepts to figure it out for yourself, but the long and short of it is that context is the information surrounding something. It's the nearby information. The sona poka! Context is very frequently a type of sona, and I feel that context is inherently close to something metaphysically, which is why "poka" works so well as a modifier in this example. You could also use any other word in place of sona. Like if you were talking about a piece of context that was also a dog, you could say "soweli poka." poka, metaphysically, means "relevant," and context is also in my opinion inherently relevant. You can also use "tenpo" to mean "situation," which is very useful for talking about specifically situational context.</p>
      <h3 id="opposite">Q - How could I talk about the opposite of something? And couldn't toki pona save on words by having one word for "opposite" and removing half of the words?</h3>
      <p><strong>A</strong> - toki pona doesn't need to have a smaller vocabulary, and such a word would take away some of the fun semantic spaces we have. Like how "sinpin" can mean "wall," and "monsi" can mean "ass." An ass is not the opposite of a wall, at least not conceptually, so these words are not opposites even if they can talk about opposite directions. If you want to talk about an opposing direction, monsi can be very useful. For concepts of returning, "sin" is very useful as well. If you want to talk about an opposite meaning, you'll need to do a bit of thinking. The opposite of the "hidden" definition of "len" may very well be something like "jan li ken lukin e ona" or "jan mute li sona e lon ona." It may require a whole sentence like that. And there is no one clear opposite of the cloth meaning of len, so there's nothing to desire there. You can also use "poka" and "ante" to describe opposing sides of something. While it doesn't necesserily mean the opposite side, and may be a different other side, for things like rivers, there are only two sides anyway. These are just some ideas about how you can talk about opposites, but remember: the concept of an opposite is pretty weird and not always as useful as you think! Speaking a language without a word for opposite can pose a very interesting challenge.</p>
      <h3 id="animal">Q - Can "soweli" be used to talk about animals in general, and not just furry land animals?</h3>
      <p><strong>A</strong> - Like probably. I have seen people use soweli like this, but only infrequently. I think it works in a pinch but if you don't want to risk it, you can always get by with an incomplete list. "soweli en akesi en waso en ijo ante kin li lon" works for "animals are here," for example. "mi jo e akesi e waso e ijo ante sama" could be "I have lots of pet animals."</p>
      <h3 id="flavors">Q - Why is suwi the only flavor word in toki pona? How can I talk about sour, umami, salt, and bitter flavors?</h3>
      <div>
        <p><strong>A</strong> - This comes up every now and then. I cook a lot, and I have a lot of thoughts about how we talk about food in general, and how we talk about food in toki pona as well. The first thing to mention here is that "kule" can be used for flavors. Now, let's explore a few very important aspects of cooking and how we can talk about them in toki pona.</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients, heat, umami, and freshness.</strong> I think that mentioning ingredients and the process of cooking is generally useful. You can describe any fruit or vegetable using kili and kasi. You can describe their color. When food gets hot enough, it changes color. This is because of caramelization and the maillard reaction, which make food grow darker in color. Describing the color can help convey the concept of umami pretty well, because umami increases with those reactions. Most umami condiments are also dark in color, like soy sauce, but some ingredients aren't necesserily, like miso paste and msg. Fresh flavors, like tartar meat and raw or lightly cooked/blanched vegetables, can be described as "lete" or "sin," because "lete" can mean "unprocessed" and "sin" can mean "fresh."</p>
        <p><strong>Bitter flavors, spicy heat, and pungancy.</strong> jaki can mean bitter pretty easily if you don't like bitter food (which most people don't). Because of the reaction that capsaicin (the spicy pepper compound) has with your tongue, you could say that if feels like your mouth is seli even though it actually isn't. Likewise you can use lete for minty flavors that make your mouth feel cold. All types of pungancy come from compounds in plants that the plants produce to prevent animals from eating them. Humans have evolved tolerances to them so that they can eat more types of food. It's evolutionary advantagious to be able to eat onions, so the humans that were resistent to allicin survived where those who weren't didn't. Nowadays, this means that we enjoy the flavors and seek them out. With this knowledge, using "utala" and "pakala" to describe the flavors of things like ginger, hot peppers, and bitter plants can be really useful.</p>
        <p><strong>Salt.</strong> I have a bad habit of assuming that everyone automatically knows that all food needs to have some salt in it and I don't really bring it up in toki pona that much! In reality, not everyone knows that. In fact, a lot of people consider it a spice, on the same level as paprika, black pepper, and coriander! I can't relate to that, but if you want to describe it, you can use the word for "powder" if it's especially fine, and if you can see the individual crystals, you can even use kiwen. Salt is usually white, so walo can be useful too. As for the flavor of salt, salt is so delicious because it mutes the unplesant aspects of pungant flavors, like the ones discussed in the previous paragraph, while emphasizing and empowering the pleasent flavors. This is why ALL FOOD MUST HAVE SALT. Do not skip the salt. Please. I'm begging you.</p>
        <p><strong>Acidity and sourness.</strong> Yellow and red fruits tend to be sour, so you can use jelo and loje with kili and describe the telo that comes from them. I've noticed that a lot of english speakers say that acidic ingredients "cut through" the flavors, and I like this description, but to tokiponize that concept I would say that the acidic ingredient brings flavors together (ona li wan e kule ale). Most acidic ingredients are liquids, so that can help a lot. Acidity can also help balance salt, which is a relationship you can discuss by using "sama" for "balanced."</p>
        <p><strong>Oils and fats.</strong> Heh can you tell I really like Samin Nosrat? Her cookbook ("salt fat acid heat") changed my life, genuinely. Fats are particularly important because they hold flavor compounds in our tastebuds. If food is bland, it's often because there isn't enough fat in it! Most aromatic compounds are oil soluble, but a much smaller portion of them are water soluble. You can describe this relationship by calling the fat you add either a ko, kiwen, or telo, and use "awen e" to describe what it does to the flavor compounds, which you can use kule for.</p>
        <p><strong>Grains and bulk staples.</strong> pan! pan is great. You can talk about any grain with pan. For legumes on the other hand, there's some disagreement. I think if you pointed to chickpeas and called them "pan," people would probably understand, but it might be a little weird and not as understandable as using pan for rice. Staple grains are actually from all over the taxonomy of plants. quinoa and farroe and wheat are all very different, but we treat them the same culinarily. Think about in what ways beans stand out from other edible seeds and see if they're different enough for you to not use the word "pan." If they are, the <em>why</em>  will guide you on how to talk about them. For me, pan works pretty well!</p>
        <p><strong>Aroma profiles and region of origin.</strong> Different ingredients are used in different cullinary traditions. For example, sumac isn't used as frequently outside of the middle east, and complex layering of spices is often associated more with south asia and east africa than with Europe. Bok Choy and sesame oil are used far more in east asian cooking, and tamarind and lemongrass are pretty squarely south east asian. Ube screams "I'm Fillipino!" and cured fish reminds us of northern Europe. Sunflower oil is from eastern europe, olive oil is from southern europe, butter is from western Europe, ghee is from south asia, niter kibbeh is from Etheopia, and so on. <strong>Different dishes are composed of ingredients that when combined in specific ways remind us of places.</strong> There's nothing wrong with bringing up one of these places in toki pona! If I'm cooking misir wot, I can totally say "ni li moku pi ma Isijopija" (this is etheopian food). If I say that, either the person knows that "ko loje" is likely berbere (or some berbere-based sauce), or they wouldn't know what berbere was in the first place and I'd have to explain that anyway. If I say "ni li moku pi ma Kanse," when I mention a ko laso you'll probably imagine herb de provence, but if I say "ni li moku pi ma Lipen (Lebanon)," you'll probably think of za'atar instead. If I mention japan and mention wrapping pan in a black lipu, you'll think of sushi, but if I mention Greece you'll think of grape leave wraps. If I am talking about a food with a selo made of pan and an insa made of soweli and kili, depending on what country I bring up, you may think of pierogis, samosas, gyoza, enchaladas, raviolli, or momos.</p>
