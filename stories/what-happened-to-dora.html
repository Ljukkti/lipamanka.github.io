        <p>This will serve as my journal trying to figure out what happened to Dora Lipman (my great great aunt). I plan on sharing this at some point, but it's unclear when. I decided to begin writing when I realized that there may be something to this book I found in my Grandfather's attic. </p>

        <p>Before I elaborate on the book, I'll give a short family history to the best of my ability. I don't have access to all the details now, but I will provide an update in this journal when I have the full picture. </p>

        <p>Some time in the late 1800s to early 1900s, Dora Lipman (17) and her parents and a few siblings fled from the pogroms of either modern day Belarus or Latvia. They landed in New York, as many Jews did at that point in time, and raised their family in Southern Brooklyn. Dora was the oldest, and the youngest was yet to be born. When he was, it was after they immigrated, and people called him "baby." It stuck like shmaltz to the bottom of a frying pan. I think someone told me once that his name was actually Jacob, but that I'm not sure should be evidence enough that he was almost exclusively referred to as "Bibi Lipman." (The only reason I know the spelling is because of two emails I was able to find from my aunt to the rest of the family talking about him and his wife in response to a poem.) </p>

        <p>Bibi had I believe three sons, the youngest of which is my paternal grandfather. He is very old (96) and he retired just a couple of years ago. This will become relevant, but before I continue, I need to make clear what happened (or rather, that we don't know what happened) to Dora Lipman in 1953. I suppose the only way to sum it up is "nobody knows!" She just disappeared. No trace, no nothing. I don't have all the details on what happened after that, but she was gone. </p>

        <p>I think I have a lead on what happened. After my grandfather retired, (not immediately; this was at the tail end of this summer 2024) my sister and I were invited (alongside everyone else in his lineage) to look through old books. I remember my grandmother saying very clearly "take whatever you would like! please!" When I found a very old book written in Biblical Hebrew, it was a little strange. When I opened it, there were scribbles in the margin in either Hebrew or Yiddish, written in the cursive version of script the two languages shared. I knew the book was Hebrew because I spoke a little Yiddish, and I didn't recognize any words skimming through. At that time I could only read block print and book print, so I assumed the notes in the margins were Hebrew as well. Without making a big deal about it I took the book with me and brought it back home (I live in the Midwest and my grandparents live just North of New York City). </p>

        <p>I've been taking Biblical Hebrew at college. It was a coincidence; I wanted to take the class anyway. But I've thrown myself into trying to understand what the book is about. Hebrew is very different from Yiddish, but now that I have SOME basics down, I've been able to figure out that the word on the cover, שערים (sh'arim), probably means "gateways." The same word can also mean "title page," so at first this was my assumption. But it shows up all over the place, along with two other words I can recognize: המלך (hamelekh, "the king"), and תהום (t'hom, "abyss"). I'm going to do more research into these words. </p>

        <p>Part of learning biblical Hebrew is apparently learning the handwritten version of the alephbet, which meant that I was able to read the text in the margins. It was clear immediately upon revisiting the book that the notes in the margin were Yiddish, and I recognized the name דאָראַ ליפּמאַן (Dora Lipman) written at the bottom of the notes on the internal cover page. The reason I'm documenting this in a journal is because next to the word שערים in the internal cover page was written "פּאָרטאַלן" (portaln), which is a Yiddish word for "portals" that comes directly from english. </p>

        <p>As I learn more about what this book is talking about, I might be able to find out what happened to her. If she was able to open a portal somewhere, that would explain why she went missing, and especially why nobody could find her after she went missing. I know that it isn't all that plausible, but I've seen lots of weird things throughout my life, and I'm going to figure this one out.</p>

        <p>I'll write more as I learn more.</p>

        <p>I've made a really interesting discovery. The Hebrew word תהום (t'hom, "abyss") is, according to wiktionary, cognate with Akkadian  𒀀𒀊𒁀 (tiāmtum, "sea"), but 𒀀𒀊𒁀 is also the name of the primordial Mesopotamian goddess of the sea (known in English as Tiamat). In fact, whenever this word shows up in the Hebrew bible, it makes sense to assume that it's talking about her.</p>

        <p>This isn't something I came up with; there are a lot of theologians who believe this is likely. Genesis 1:2 was probably "And the earth was formless and void and darkness, and the spirit of G-d was over the face of Tiamat" not "over the face of the abyss." A lot of theologians believe that this was to assert dominance over other ethnoreligious groups in the area (modern day Palestine, Jordan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, etc.).</p>

        <p>I'm not a very strong theist. I'm still not convinced that the gateways this book is talking about are actually real. (I'm going to go with "gateway" instead of "portal" to be more faithful to the original hebrew.) But I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and try anyway.</p>
