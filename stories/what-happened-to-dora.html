        <p>This will serve as my journal trying to figure out what happened to Dora Lipman (my great great aunt). I decided to begin writing when I realized that there may be something to this book I found in my Grandfather's attic. </p>

        <p>Before I elaborate on the book, I'll give a short family history to the best of my ability. I don't have access to all the details now, but I will provide an update in this journal when I have the full picture. </p>

        <p>Some time in the late 1800s to early 1900s, Dora Lipman (17) and her parents and a few siblings fled from the pogroms of either modern day Belarus or Latvia. They landed in New York, as many Jews did at that point in time, and raised their family in Southern Brooklyn. Dora was the oldest, and the youngest was yet to be born. When he was, it was after they immigrated, and people called him "baby." It stuck like shmaltz to the bottom of a frying pan. I think someone told me once that his name was actually Jacob, but that I'm not sure should be evidence enough that he was almost exclusively referred to as "Bibi Lipman." (The only reason I know the spelling is because of two emails I was able to find from my aunt to the rest of the family talking about him and his wife in response to a poem.) </p>

        <p>Bibi had I believe three sons, the youngest of which is my paternal grandfather. He is very old (96) and he retired just a couple of years ago. This will become relevant, but before I continue, I need to make clear what happened (or rather, that we don't know what happened) to Dora Lipman in 1953. I suppose the only way to sum it up is "nobody knows!" She just disappeared. No trace, no nothing. I don't have all the details on what happened after that, but she was gone. </p>

        <p>I think I have a lead on what happened. After my grandfather retired, (not immediately; this was at the tail end of this summer 2024) my sister and I were invited (alongside everyone else in his lineage) to look through old books. I remember my grandmother saying very clearly "take whatever you would like! please!" When I found a very old book written in Biblical Hebrew, it was a little strange. When I opened it, there were scribbles in the margin in either Hebrew or Yiddish, written in the cursive version of script the two languages shared. I knew the book was Hebrew because I spoke a little Yiddish, and I didn't recognize any words skimming through. At that time I could only read block print and book print, so I assumed the notes in the margins were Hebrew as well. Without making a big deal about it I took the book with me and brought it back home (I live in the Midwest and my grandparents live just North of New York City). </p>

        <p>I've been taking Biblical Hebrew at college. It was a coincidence; I wanted to take the class anyway. But I've thrown myself into trying to understand what the book is about. Hebrew is very different from Yiddish, but now that I have SOME basics down, I've been able to figure out that the word on the cover, שערים (sh'arim), probably means "gateways." The same word can also mean "title page," so at first this was my assumption. But it shows up all over the place, along with two other words I can recognize: המלך (hamelekh, "the king"), and תהום (t'hom, "abyss"). I'm going to do more research into these words. </p>

        <p>Part of learning biblical Hebrew is apparently learning the handwritten version of the alephbet, which meant that I was able to read the text in the margins. It was clear immediately upon revisiting the book that the notes in the margin were Yiddish, and I recognized the name דאָראַ ליפּמאַן (Dora Lipman) written at the bottom of the notes on the internal cover page. The reason I'm documenting this in a journal is because next to the word שערים in the internal cover page was written "פּאָרטאַלן" (portaln), which is a Yiddish word for "portals" that comes directly from english. </p>

        <p>As I learn more about what this book is talking about, I might be able to find out what happened to her. If she was able to open a portal somewhere, that would explain why she went missing, and especially why nobody could find her after she went missing. I know that it isn't all that plausible, but I've seen lots of weird things throughout my life, and I'm going to figure this one out.</p>

        <p>I'll write more as I learn more.</p>

        <p>I've made a really interesting discovery. The Hebrew word תהום (t'hom, "abyss") is, according to wiktionary, cognate with Akkadian  𒀀𒀊𒁀 (tiāmtum, "sea"), but 𒀀𒀊𒁀 is also the name of the primordial Mesopotamian goddess of the sea (known in English as Tiamat). In fact, whenever this word shows up in the Hebrew bible, it makes sense to assume that it's talking about her.</p>

        <p>This isn't something I came up with; there are a lot of theologians who believe this is likely. Genesis 1:2 was probably "And the earth was formless and void and darkness, and the spirit of G-d was over the face of Tiamat" not "over the face of the abyss." A lot of theologians believe that this was to assert dominance over other ethnoreligious groups in the area (modern day Palestine, Jordan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, etc.).</p>

        <p>I'm not a very strong theist. I'm still not convinced that the gateways this book is talking about are actually real. (I'm going to go with "gateway" instead of "portal" to be more faithful to the original hebrew.) But I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and try anyway.</p>

        <p>So I've been skimming Dora's notebook, and this one line she wrote (apparently on a saturday morning or friday night, I know that because the entry starts with גוט שבת "gut shabes!") this:</p>

        <p>איך װיל מאָלן אַ כּישופֿדיק עיגול -"ikh vil moln a kishefdik igl" "I want to draw a magic circle"</p>

        <p>(this is transcribed in block script; I would have to set up a Hebrew handwriting font to display how it actually looked in the notebook. If I ever do that, I will remove this paragraph and change it.)</p>

        <p>As I've mentioned, my Yiddish isn't great. In fact, it's pretty bad. Most of the sentences here are too long and complex for me to understand confidently, but I know enough, and I have a subscription to an online searchable yiddish dictionary. This sentence is pretty straightforward. The following sentences include stuff like "שרײַב עס אױפֿן דער שפּיץ פֿון דער עיגול" - "shrayb es afn der shpits fun der igl" "write this at the top of the circle" followed by something that resembles the common hebrew prayer "בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי" (barukh atah adonai, meaning "blessed are you, g-d"), save that "adonai" is replaced with תהום (which, if you remember, is Tiamat).</p>

        <p>Does this count as worshiping a lesser idol? I mean, It is quite literally a prayer that says "blessed are you, [another god that is not adonai]." But this doesn't bother me too much. The instructions are all here, I just need to decipher and translate the Yiddish. (And I am not sure how irresponsible it would be to share all of the details on the internet, so I will keep those to myself until I am 100% positive that the magic circle doesn't do anything.)</p>

        <p>How long will it take me to finish deciphering Dora's instructions for creating a magic circle? I'm not sure honestly. But I am at this time confident that the basic concept (whether it works or not) is that Tiamat will open a gateway when a magic circle is created. I found the phrase ותהום תפתח השער "v't'hom tifta3 hasha'ar" which literally means "and the depths (Tiamat) will open the gateway." It's one of the only parts of the Hebrew I've been able to understand just reading through the book. Boy am I glad Dora wrote instructions in Yiddish, a language that is much easier for me to translate from.</p>

        <p>Next time I write a journal entry, I may have determined that the gateway does not work.</p>

        <summary>Oct 1 2024 2nd entry</summary>
        <p>I should note that another reason why it makes sense that the book considers t'hom to be Tiamat and not "abyss" is because it never uses the definite article "ha." If it wasn't a name (which is definite by default), it would need "ha" in order to be "the abyss" instead of "an abyss." So unless "t'hom" is a name in "v't'hom tifta3 hasha'ar," it would actually be "v'hat'hom" instead of "v't'hom." Fun fact: this is also true for Genesis 1:2! Checkmate, monotheists!</p>

        <p>Theologically this is interesting because it shows that at one point, Jews believed in more than just one god (which is commonly accepted as very likely by theologians as far as I can tell). Stuff like this shows up all over the bible. But I've never encountered a  biblical hebrew text that claims to worship a different god with rituals this specific. (Or, what I'm assuming to be this specific.)</p>

        <p>But like, who cares. Because I spent all day so far (except for when I had to go to campus for a Hebrew class and a voice lesson) fiddling with the gateway magic circle, and I followed the directions perfectly. It says to draw the magic circle above a doorway, but I printed it out instead on sticker paper at my campus art lab. I don't know what I was expecting, but the portal has done nothing! What a waste of time!</p>

        <p>I suppose I'll never know what happened to Dora. I thought I had a lead! What a shonda. idk what I was expecting though, obviously it wasn't going to work. This page will stand as a testament to how I thought magic was real.</p>

        <p>I will no longer be updating this page.</p>

        <summary>Oct 1 2024 3rd entry</summary>
        <p>Oh my g-d. LORD. Jesus Fucking Christ in a fucking Cradle. I wrote "adonai" instead of "t'hom." I remade the entire magic circle and this time I used my label maker thermal printer thing to print it out. I activated it (with a prayer to Tiamat that I am not going to share) and I am dumbfounded. It actually worked. I opened the door and instead of leading into the hallway, it led into a field filled with grass that smelled like honey.</p>

        <p>I looked around for a little bit and saw PEOPLE in the distance. They were wearing very long sarongs. I got anxious and shut the door before they could get closer. I think they were herding animals but I couldn't get a good look. When I looked at the magic circle, it had faded entirely and when I opened the door again it led right to the hallway, and still I smelt the sweet scent of the grass from the other world.</p>

        <p>This. This is. Like I genuinely don't know how to feel about this?? I actually don't have classes on Thursday. I will spend the night before preparing to embark into this mysterious land. I've found a quote that I am confident clarifies that these gateways work both ways, so I'll bring plenty of extra printed magic circles for myself, as well as plenty of food. I will buy a portable battery with solar panels on it tomorrow (wednesday) on my way home from school. I know the hardware store on the way sells them on the second floor. This is just so my computer doesn't run out of charge. I have NO IDEA if there will be outlets, but when I opened the door it was daytime, so I know at least they have a sun.</p>

        <p>On second thought, I should translate more of the Hebrew to avoid getting lost in the other world as I assume Dora did many years ago. idk. I will go to sleep now and decide during the day tomorrow what the best course of action is.</p>

        <p>A thought I had though: what language do they speak in the other world? No way in hell is it English, unless somehow the portal brought me to Ireland or New Zealand. But people in Anglophone countries don't usually herd animals while wearing sarongs to my knowledge. idk.</p>

        <p>I'm also thinking about what this means for my religious beliefs. I have PROOF that a god that is not hashem exists. Otherwise, how would a prayer to the abstract concept of the abyss from Genesis 1:2 open a gateway to another world, but a prayer to hashem wouldn't? Not that this disproves hashem's existence. Good thing I'm a reconstructionist Jew, otherwise I would have to feel bad about cherry picking away "thou shalt not have any god before me" or whatever that commandment was.</p>

        <p>And finally: what does this mean for me as a person who exists in THIS world? Obviously I may be crazy. Or, like, I may have a psychotic disorder. Or something. But there is no history of psychosis in my family (I checked with both of my parents). So I think my plan going forward is that besides this log on my website, I don't tell anyone about this. Maybe my roommate, Lyle, but probably not.</p>

        <p>Going forward, I will assume that I am NOT crazy. This is all real.</p>

        <p>I worry about what may happen if the nation states of our world find out about these gateways. Basically I'm thinking about colonialism. I don't know how well equipped the people on the other side of the gateway are to fight back against colonizers, and I don't want to let that happen to them. If you work for any government in any capacity, I AM crazy! Do not pursue this any further. I am the type of non-dangerous eccentric crazy that you can just ignore :3</p>

        <p>Anyway I should really go to sleep. I just have so many THOUGHTS. This is kind of my stream of consciousness. Good night, interent people.</p>

        <p>Hello, everyone! I am wezzl the weasel. lipamanka is obviously not prepared, so I have spent the morning translating a list of "warnings" from the original hebrew book. (There is a section labeled "השמר" which is like "take heed" or "be careful"). Evidently, there are no notes in the margins, so Dora prolly didn't read this part too carefully. I don't blame her, it's kind of tucked into the back of the book. It's like near the last page.</p>

        <p>It's kind of hard to figure out what parts of this are conditionals but luckily I'm ABOUT to go to hebrew class so I can ask the professor lol. I think "אשר" (aser) is like "if" but kind of? I'm not really sure. wiktionary says it's not. There's also ים which wiktionary DOES say means "if" but I don't really get how it works because word order is so weird.</p>

        <p>But like anyway. What I've been able to tell is</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>each magic cirlce design only ever leads to one other world (and I'm not even sure if there are other known magic circle designs in the book)</p></li>
            <li><p>if you keep the book with you, you'll always be able to get back, but if you leave it behind, you problly wont (this may be what happeneed with dora idk I'm just a weasel</p></li>
            <li><p>God I really miss Jane. This isnt'r realated to the thing. maybe a little bit but. She's been gone for a while adn I really loved her</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Maybe I shouldn't talk about Jane here. It's prolly a bad idea; but i don't care >:( I miss her :(</p>

        <p>Anyway. I have scanned all the pages in both the book and the notebook and I will be packing our laptop in the bag or whatever. Good luck lipamanka. I hope you find dora's legacy. Maybe I'll be bable to help at some point.</p>

        <p>Read back what wezzl wrote in the last entry. I'm thankful for his measured approach to moving forward and for the effort he put into making sure I wouldn't go in unprepared. I'm going to take the physical copy of the book with me and upload the scans to google drive.</p>

        <p>I don't really know how to feel about Wezzl talking about Jane. I will. Put Off Thinking About This™.</p>

        <p>I made myself a chicken stir fry and it's in the fridge. I'll set off into the other world tomorrow in the morning, unless I chicken out.</p>

        <p>Usually when I get home, I cook right away before checking anything, and it didn't occur to me that wezzl might have written an entry even though I knew that he was around earlier today. But he's welcome to be as involved as he'd like; Dora is his great great aunt too. Cooking took a while. It took about an hour. The stir fry has fresh steamed and fried soybeans, a LOT of garlic, cauliflower, and of course chicken marinated in olive oil, a few spices (just peppercorns and yellow mustard seeds for this one, but I also added some carrot family staples while cooking along with some more whole spices), and also more garlic, ginger, turmeric, and some other stuff that I forgot about.</p>

        <p>I'm also realizing that my second entry for October 1st is over dramatic and irresponsible. What a drama queen! Like, even if the portal gateway thing didn't work (which it did!! what the fuck!!), I would still have the opportunity to read through the entire notebook and try to figure out if there was a different lead somehow. Like if she went missing I'm sure I would have heard about this notebook if people knew about it, but nobody in the family could read it! Duh, it was in yiddish.</p>

        <p>Learn from my mistakes and don't give up when the first thing you try doesn't work.</p>

        <p>In any case, I just wanted to get this out now; I may have more to say before tomorrow (or even later today!). We'll see.</p>
