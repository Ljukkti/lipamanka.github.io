            <p>This will serve as my journal trying to figure out what happened to Dora Lipman (my great great aunt). I decided to begin writing when I realized that there may be something to this book I found in my Grandfather's attic. </p>

            <p>Before I elaborate on the book, I'll give a short family history to the best of my ability. I don't have access to all the details now, but I will provide an update in this journal when I have the full picture. </p>

            <p>Some time in the late 1800s to early 1900s, Dora Lipman (17) and her parents and a few siblings fled from the pogroms of either modern day Belarus or Latvia. They landed in New York, as many Jews did at that point in time, and raised their family in Southern Brooklyn. Dora was the oldest, and the youngest was yet to be born. When he was, it was after they immigrated, and people called him "baby." It stuck like shmaltz to the bottom of a frying pan. I think someone told me once that his name was actually Jacob, but that I'm not sure should be evidence enough that he was almost exclusively referred to as "Bibi Lipman." (The only reason I know the spelling is because of two emails I was able to find from my aunt to the rest of the family talking about him and his wife in response to a poem.) </p>

            <p>Bibi had I believe three sons, the youngest of which is my paternal grandfather. He is very old (96) and he retired just a couple of years ago. This will become relevant, but before I continue, I need to make clear what happened (or rather, that we don't know what happened) to Dora Lipman in 1953. I suppose the only way to sum it up is "nobody knows!" She just disappeared. No trace, no nothing. I don't have all the details on what happened after that, but she was gone. </p>

            <p>I think I have a lead on what happened. After my grandfather retired, (not immediately; this was at the tail end of this summer 2024) my sister and I were invited (alongside everyone else in his lineage) to look through old books. I remember my grandmother saying very clearly "take whatever you would like! please!" When I found a very old book written in Biblical Hebrew, it was a little strange. When I opened it, there were scribbles in the margin in either Hebrew or Yiddish, written in the cursive version of script the two languages shared. I knew the book was Hebrew because I spoke a little Yiddish, and I didn't recognize any words skimming through. At that time I could only read block print and book print, so I assumed the notes in the margins were Hebrew as well. Without making a big deal about it I took the book with me and brought it back home (I live in the Midwest and my grandparents live just North of New York City). </p>

            <p>I've been taking Biblical Hebrew at college. It was a coincidence; I wanted to take the class anyway. But I've thrown myself into trying to understand what the book is about. Hebrew is very different from Yiddish, but now that I have SOME basics down, I've been able to figure out that the word on the cover, שערים (sh'arim), probably means "gateways." The same word can also mean "title page," so at first this was my assumption. But it shows up all over the place, along with two other words I can recognize: המלך (hamelekh, "the king"), and תהום (t'hom, "abyss"). I'm going to do more research into these words. </p>

            <p>Part of learning biblical Hebrew is apparently learning the handwritten version of the alephbet, which meant that I was able to read the text in the margins. It was clear immediately upon revisiting the book that the notes in the margin were Yiddish, and I recognized the name דאָראַ ליפּמאַן (Dora Lipman) written at the bottom of the notes on the internal cover page. The reason I'm documenting this in a journal is because next to the word שערים in the internal cover page was written "פּאָרטאַלן" (portaln), which is a Yiddish word for "portals" that comes directly from english. </p>

            <p>As I learn more about what this book is talking about, I might be able to find out what happened to her. If she was able to open a portal somewhere, that would explain why she went missing, and especially why nobody could find her after she went missing. I know that it isn't all that plausible, but I've seen lots of weird things throughout my life, and I'm going to figure this one out.</p>

            <p>I'll write more as I learn more.</p>

            <p>I've made a really interesting discovery. The Hebrew word תהום (t'hom, "abyss") is, according to wiktionary, cognate with Akkadian  𒀀𒀊𒁀 (tiāmtum, "sea"), but 𒀀𒀊𒁀 is also the name of the primordial Mesopotamian goddess of the sea (known in English as Tiamat). In fact, whenever this word shows up in the Hebrew bible, it makes sense to assume that it's talking about her.</p>

            <p>This isn't something I came up with; there are a lot of theologians who believe this is likely. Genesis 1:2 was probably "And the earth was formless and void and darkness, and the spirit of G-d was over the face of Tiamat" not "over the face of the abyss." A lot of theologians believe that this was to assert dominance over other ethnoreligious groups in the area (modern day Palestine, Jordan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, etc.).</p>

            <p>I'm not a very strong theist. I'm still not convinced that the gateways this book is talking about are actually real. (I'm going to go with "gateway" instead of "portal" to be more faithful to the original hebrew.) But I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and try anyway.</p>

            <summary id="oct-1-2024">12:00 AM on the dot</summary>
            <p>So I've been skimming Dora's notebook, and this one line she wrote (apparently on a saturday morning or friday night, I know that because the entry starts with גוט שבת "gut shabes!") this:</p>

            <p>איך װיל מאָלן אַ כּישופֿדיק עיגול -"ikh vil moln a kishefdik igl" "I want to draw a magic circle"</p>

            <p>(this is transcribed in block script; I would have to set up a Hebrew handwriting font to display how it actually looked in the notebook. If I ever do that, I will remove this paragraph and change it.)</p>

            <p>As I've mentioned, my Yiddish isn't great. In fact, it's pretty bad. Most of the sentences here are too long and complex for me to understand confidently, but I know enough, and I have a subscription to an online searchable yiddish dictionary. This sentence is pretty straightforward. The following sentences include stuff like "שרײַב עס אױפֿן דער שפּיץ פֿון דער עיגול" - "shrayb es afn der shpits fun der igl" "write this at the top of the circle" followed by something that resembles the common hebrew prayer "בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי" (barukh atah adonai, meaning "blessed are you, g-d"), save that "adonai" is replaced with תהום (which, if you remember, is Tiamat).</p>

            <p>Does this count as worshiping a lesser idol? I mean, It is quite literally a prayer that says "blessed are you, [another god that is not adonai]." But this doesn't bother me too much. The instructions are all here, I just need to decipher and translate the Yiddish. (And I am not sure how irresponsible it would be to share all of the details on the internet, so I will keep those to myself until I am 100% positive that the magic circle doesn't do anything.)</p>

            <p>How long will it take me to finish deciphering Dora's instructions for creating a magic circle? I'm not sure honestly. But I am at this time confident that the basic concept (whether it works or not) is that Tiamat will open a gateway when a magic circle is created. I found the phrase ותהום תפתח השער "v't'hom tifta3 hasha'ar" which literally means "and the depths (Tiamat) will open the gateway." It's one of the only parts of the Hebrew I've been able to understand just reading through the book. Boy am I glad Dora wrote instructions in Yiddish, a language that is much easier for me to translate from.</p>

            <p>Next time I write a journal entry, I may have determined that the gateway does not work.</p>

            <summary>3:04 PM</summary>
            <p>I should note that another reason why it makes sense that the book considers t'hom to be Tiamat and not "abyss" is because it never uses the definite article "ha." If it wasn't a name (which is definite by default), it would need "ha" in order to be "the abyss" instead of "an abyss." So unless "t'hom" is a name in "v't'hom tifta3 hasha'ar," it would actually be "v'hat'hom" instead of "v't'hom." Fun fact: this is also true for Genesis 1:2! Checkmate, monotheists!</p>

            <p>Theologically this is interesting because it shows that at one point, Jews believed in more than just one god (which is commonly accepted as very likely by theologians as far as I can tell). Stuff like this shows up all over the bible. But I've never encountered a  biblical hebrew text that claims to worship a different god with rituals this specific. (Or, what I'm assuming to be this specific.)</p>

            <p>But like, who cares. Because I spent all day so far (except for when I had to go to campus for a Hebrew class and a voice lesson) fiddling with the gateway magic circle, and I followed the directions perfectly. It says to draw the magic circle above a doorway, but I printed it out instead on sticker paper at my campus art lab. I don't know what I was expecting, but the portal has done nothing! What a waste of time!</p>

            <p>I suppose I'll never know what happened to Dora. I thought I had a lead! What a shonda. idk what I was expecting though, obviously it wasn't going to work. This page will stand as a testament to how I thought magic was real.</p>

            <p>I will no longer be updating this page.</p>

            <p>Oh my g-d. LORD. Jesus Fucking Christ in a fucking Cradle. I wrote "adonai" instead of "t'hom." I remade the entire magic circle and this time I used my label maker thermal printer thing to print it out. I activated it (with a prayer to Tiamat that I am not going to share) and I am dumbfounded. It actually worked. I opened the door and instead of leading into the hallway, it led into a field filled with grass that smelled like honey.</p>

            <p>I looked around for a little bit and saw PEOPLE in the distance. They were wearing very long sarongs. I got anxious and shut the door before they could get closer. I think they were herding animals but I couldn't get a good look. When I looked at the magic circle, it had faded entirely and when I opened the door again it led right to the hallway, and still I smelt the sweet scent of the grass from the other world.</p>

            <p>This. This is. Like I genuinely don't know how to feel about this?? I actually don't have classes on Thursday. I will spend the night before preparing to embark into this mysterious land. I've found a quote that I am confident clarifies that these gateways work both ways, so I'll bring plenty of extra printed magic circles for myself, as well as plenty of food. I will buy a portable battery with solar panels on it tomorrow (wednesday) on my way home from school. I know the hardware store on the way sells them on the second floor. This is just so my computer doesn't run out of charge. I have NO IDEA if there will be outlets, but when I opened the door it was daytime, so I know at least they have a sun.</p>

            <p>On second thought, I should translate more of the Hebrew to avoid getting lost in the other world as I assume Dora did many years ago. idk. I will go to sleep now and decide during the day tomorrow what the best course of action is.</p>

            <p>A thought I had though: what language do they speak in the other world? No way in hell is it English, unless somehow the portal brought me to Ireland or New Zealand. But people in Anglophone countries don't usually herd animals while wearing sarongs to my knowledge. idk.</p>

            <p>I'm also thinking about what this means for my religious beliefs. I have PROOF that a god that is not hashem exists. Otherwise, how would a prayer to the abstract concept of the abyss from Genesis 1:2 open a gateway to another world, but a prayer to hashem wouldn't? Not that this disproves hashem's existence. Good thing I'm a reconstructionist Jew, otherwise I would have to feel bad about cherry picking away "thou shalt not have any god before me" or whatever that commandment was.</p>

            <p>And finally: what does this mean for me as a person who exists in THIS world? Obviously I may be crazy. Or, like, I may have a psychotic disorder. Or something. But there is no history of psychosis in my family (I checked with both of my parents). So I think my plan going forward is that besides this log on my website, I don't tell anyone about this. Maybe my roommate, Lyle, but probably not.</p>

            <p>Going forward, I will assume that I am NOT crazy. This is all real.</p>

            <p>I worry about what may happen if the nation states of our world find out about these gateways. Basically I'm thinking about colonialism. I don't know how well equipped the people on the other side of the gateway are to fight back against colonizers, and I don't want to let that happen to them. If you work for any government in any capacity, I AM crazy! Do not pursue this any further. I am the type of non-dangerous eccentric crazy that you can just ignore :3</p>

            <p>Anyway I should really go to sleep. I just have so many THOUGHTS. This is kind of my stream of consciousness. Good night, interent people.</p>

            <p>Hello, everyone! I am wezzl the weasel. lipamanka is obviously not prepared, so I have spent the morning translating a list of "warnings" from the original hebrew book. (There is a section labeled "השמר" which is like "take heed" or "be careful"). Evidently, there are no notes in the margins, so Dora prolly didn't read this part too carefully. I don't blame her, it's kind of tucked into the back of the book. It's like near the last page.</p>

            <p>It's kind of hard to figure out what parts of this are conditionals but luckily I'm ABOUT to go to hebrew class so I can ask the professor lol. I think "אשר" (aser) is like "if" but kind of? I'm not really sure. wiktionary says it's not. There's also ים which wiktionary DOES say means "if" but I don't really get how it works because word order is so weird.</p>

            <p>But like anyway. What I've been able to tell is</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>each magic cirlce design only ever leads to one other world (and I'm not even sure if there are other known magic circle designs in the book)</p></li>
                <li><p>if you keep the book with you, you'll always be able to get back, but if you leave it behind, you problly wont (this may be what happeneed with dora idk I'm just a weasel</p></li>
                <li><p>God I really miss Jane. This isnt'r realated to the thing. maybe a little bit but. She's been gone for a while adn I really loved her</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Maybe I shouldn't talk about Jane here. It's prolly a bad idea; but i don't care >:( I miss her :(</p>

            <p>Anyway. I have scanned all the pages in both the book and the notebook and I will be packing our laptop in the bag or whatever. Good luck lipamanka. I hope you find dora's legacy. Maybe I'll be bable to help at some point.</p>

            <p>Read back what wezzl wrote in the last entry. I'm thankful for his measured approach to moving forward and for the effort he put into making sure I wouldn't go in unprepared. I'm going to take the physical copy of the book with me and upload the scans to google drive.</p>

            <p>I don't really know how to feel about Wezzl talking about Jane. I will. Put Off Thinking About This™.</p>

            <p>I made myself a chicken stir fry and it's in the fridge. I'll set off into the other world tomorrow in the morning, unless I chicken out.</p>

            <p>Usually when I get home, I cook right away before checking anything, and it didn't occur to me that wezzl might have written an entry even though I knew that he was around earlier today. But he's welcome to be as involved as he'd like; Dora is his great great aunt too. Cooking took a while. It took about an hour. The stir fry has fresh steamed and fried soybeans, a LOT of garlic, cauliflower, and of course chicken marinated in olive oil, a few spices (just peppercorns and yellow mustard seeds for this one, but I also added some carrot family staples while cooking along with some more whole spices), and also more garlic, ginger, turmeric, and some other stuff that I forgot about.</p>

            <p>I'm also realizing that my second entry for October 1st is over dramatic and irresponsible. What a drama queen! Like, even if the portal gateway thing didn't work (which it did!! what the fuck!!), I would still have the opportunity to read through the entire notebook and try to figure out if there was a different lead somehow. Like if she went missing I'm sure I would have heard about this notebook if people knew about it, but nobody in the family could read it! Duh, it was in yiddish.</p>

            <p>Learn from my mistakes and don't give up when the first thing you try doesn't work.</p>

            <p>In any case, I just wanted to get this out now; I may have more to say before tomorrow (or even later today!). We'll see.</p>

            <p>G-d. I am tired. This whole day has been exhausting. I'm heading to sleep soon, but before I do, I want to make a plan for language contact. There's a very real chance that they won't speak a language I speak. I can't discount the possibility that they speak biblical Hebrew or a descendant of it, or something like Akkadian, or some other semitic language. But I'm not going to expect that. I'm not going to expect anything! Who knows, they might speak English for some reason! And if they did, I would be very interested in figuring out how.</p>

            <p>I guess this kind of goes into like. If it's possible to create gateways to this world (and maybe others?), how many times has it been done in the past? Does anyone else have a copy of the Hebrew book I have? I guess I'll find out. Or maybe I won't.</p>

            <p>BUT back to language: I don't want to fall into the trap of approaching speakers of a language I don't speak with a checklist and trying to figure out what European things their language does. But I need some structure going into it.</p>

            <p>I think it makes sense to start by describing what sounds I hear. Oh god I hope the phonology isn't too complicated. Eventually I'll be able to do like optimality theory and stuff to it. Feature geometry. All that good stuff.</p>

            <p>I hope they're nice! Once again, no assumptions, and that includes both the "noble savage" trope and the "wild person" trope. I am not going to assume either of those! But I am going to hope that they are kind to me lol; especially because I'm not sure if I'll come through one of their doorways or not.</p>

            <p>Now that I think about it, if I open a gateway FROM that world, where will it end up? My room? Another country? I don't have that much money in my bank account but if I NEED to, assuming I don't end up in Melanesia (well. Melanesia specifically wouldn't be too bad because I speak Tok Pisin), I can get a plane ticket back. MAYbe.</p>

            <p>On that vein. What if the reverse is true? What if I end up in a different country in the other world each time? Or what if it's just a gateway to Melanesia? I have no idea what will happen. But impulsivity is the begetter of innovation. As I mentioned, I will not make any assumptions! But writing out my speculations is helping quell my nerves.</p>

            <p>I hope I'm back in time for my bagpipe lesson!</p>

            <p>I will add one more entry tomorrow before I open the gateway again. If I don't send an update making sure I'm okay, I have given one person the scans wezzl took of the book and the notebook; someone I trust, who won't share or use them unless I go missing. I am an amateur explorer of alternate dimensions! If I make it back and to a place with wifi I will let you all know! Don't come looking for me until two days are finished; I may need that much time to like, find my way to a place with wifi in Melanesia. Or cell service! I can get a friend to submit a pr on github and approve it one one bar.</p>

            <p>Honestly getting stranded in Melanesia wouldn't be the worst thing. Well, if it was Papua New Guinea, anyway. I really want to visit Papua New Guinea, and I speak tok pisin kind of.</p>

            <p>But moving forward, be aware that I am cognizant of all of the above. I'm going to suspend my disbelief and pretend that I can somehow decide where my gateways take me. Even though I know that that may not be true, and even if the portals take me to consistent places, it won't be because I have control over them. I digress way any out-of-the-way, as they say.</p>

            <p>It's really getting late. At the time of writing, it's already 11 PM, and I won't have much time to do field research before having to return in time for my bagpipe lesson at 4:00. And sleeping isn't easy for me. So I will head to bed right now. Good night!</p>

            <p>I'm about to head out! I have the magic circle placed above the door at the time of writing, and I'm just waiting to work up the nerve to just GO THROUGH THE DAMN DOOR. I can already smell the same honey scent of grass. I'm not sure if grass does that here or not. But anyway I am confident that the portal will probably take me to the same place. Which means that MAYBE, as long as I put my return portal on the same doorway, it'll take me right back to my room. We'll see! </p>
            
            <p>OH RIGHT! I should probably set a timer for myself. A vibration based one, of course. I wouldn't want to freak out the locals with a strange noise. I'm going to try to be quiet.</p>

                <li><p>picture of my mom's cat (I love her so much her name is cloud)</p></li>
                <li><p>picture of myself and some friends posing in front of a landmark (I will not specify which here) so I can show the people there my friends</p></li>
                <li><p>Pretty high quality recorder with clip microphones! I'm surprised I could find one of these where I am, but I will leave it running the whole time. We'll see how useful it is. It is waterproof, but the clip on microphone is probably less waterproof.</p></li>
                <li><p>a gallon of water. (no, seriously. I get thirsty really easily and I have no idea how drinkable the water is there.)</p></li>

            <p>And that's it! That's all I have! Wait, that's it? FUCK! What if I get bitten by a SNAKE?? what if- wait hold one one sec.</p>

            <p>Okay I went and grabbed some whole spices. Maybe I can trade them for something! Or offer them as a gift for good hospitality! And I tied a sweatshirt around my waist in case it gets cold. Though i have a really good tolerance. I now have black cardamom, some ancho chiles, and saffron. (I know I shouldn't be taking my saffron with me to a parallel universe but (1) it's really good, and (2) my parents are in morocco right now and they said they would bring me back saffron. (They always get saffron when they visit morocco. Which they do.. frequently for some reason? Never really thought about it. I've never been though.)</p>

            <p>Okay! Signing off! See you… later! I hope! I should be back in three to four hours. We'll see. Wish me luck! Pray for me! (G-d I am scared as fuck.)</p>

            <p>I'M BACK! IT WENT GREAT!! So immediate notes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>The gateways are really easy to set up. They lead directly to specific doors in the other world. I tried some other doors out there; they all led to different doors in the city I live in. So there's that! I even found one door that led to the same normally locked room at my college campus. They keep ingredients there; now I have a good source of free avocados! As long as I don't get caught.</p></li>
                <li><p>The people are really nice! I was able to get by with pointing at things, and they kept pointing at my nose for some reason and turning to each other and saying what I am transcribing for now as [ʔoɾiˈtʼaɾo]. They seemed really excited about it. Good thing I'm good at making ejectives! Still not sure if those are phonemic yet.</p></li>
                <li><p>The people are really generous with food. They fed me some food (a cooked fruit that was very juicy; they called it [tumpamontiˈpeɾ] (which is long, I know, but I recorded everything!)) No idea what it was but it was really good. To thank them I gave them my black cardamom but held off with everything else; I don't want to give them ALL my spices. I was going to offer them my beans too but I realized that they were pinto beans, and if pinto beans are not cooked properly, they can be extremely poisonous!</p></li>
                <li><p>Time is different there. It was very very very early when I arrived (like the sun hadn't risen yet), but there were already a few children playing outside, and they seemed to get.. their parents? (I have no idea how their kinship works yet). When I left the sun wasn't even overhead yet. I'd guess they're like, five hours behind us? That sounds about right. The children were both trying to help me learn the language, I think? They kept pointing at things and naming them.</p></li>
                <li><p>They do not, in fact, speak biblical hebrew, or another semitic language, as far as I can tell.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>So far I've been able to piece together the following phones: p t k q (with ejectives and maybe labial forms for each), m n ŋ and ɴ (though I only heard ɴ twice, and maybe I misheard it? I'll have to check again later.), w (or maybe there are labialized consonants? idk.), f, ʃ, ʒ, s (I didn't hear z! but maybe it exists.), and ɾ (no l! how odd! Just kidding Japanese is like right there lol). also it seems like they have a five vowel system, though they might have seven vowels with e and ɛ and o and ɔ. so here is my consonant chart, using parentheses for things I'm not sure about yet:</p>

            <p>Of course, this might all be wrong! I have no idea! If it is, I will come back and edit this to say "as of [date] it has become clear to me that this is inaccurate" with a link to a more up to date or more accurate chart. I doubt that won't happen.</p>

            <p>Other than the sounds, I have some words! Especially from the children, one of whom kept pointing at things and telling me what they were called, including themselves and other people, so I have some names too. The names are, for the children: [usulamaˈpʼer] [ɾipʼiˈpʼer] and for the adults: [ʒoniˈkʼer] (though one of the adults said the same thing without the ejective, [ʒoniˈkeɾ]), [uqʼuˈmeɾ], and finally, what they called me, [tˈoɾaˈpʼeɾ] (the adults called me [tˈoɾaˈpeɾ] without the ejective?). But importantly:</p>
            <p>all names end with "per," "ker," or "mer." My guess is that the morpheme is /-ker/ or /-per/ and has a bunch of allomorphs, but beyond that I'm not sure. Perhaps all of the names I've heard so far are irregular! I haven't really heard that many. But if my name is [tˈoɾaˈpʼeɾ], they were very quick to assign it to ME. Maybe it's a nickname?</p>
                
            <p>Now that I think about it, ejectives probably aren't phonemic because I have an example of free variation. But I won't write that off just yet until I have time to analyze this data better after my bagpipe lesson later today.</p>

            <p>Also. Upon returning, I've realized that I should have bought a water bladder. I... don't think I need to bring that much water anymore!</p>

            <p>I'm about to head out for my bagpipe lesson! I will add more details (and list all of the words I was able to transcribe with a meaning attached) when I return home in several hours.</p>

            <p>HELLO everyone! I have a little extra time because I INJURED MYSELF and had to leave my bagpipe lesson early. So this is coming out earlier than expected!</p>

            <p>I'm just now realizing that השמר (hisshaamer) is probably related to שמר (sh-m-r) which is a pretty important root. wiktionary suggests that ה at the beginning is an archaic interrogative particle? But that one has a different niqqud under it than the one in hisamer (not that the book HAS niqqud, but I can't really see the translation making much sense if it was a different derivation of h-sh-m-r). I asked my professor about it and she responded very quickly and told me "It's an imperative of a binyan called Nif'al which is essentially in the passive of Pa'al.  It means something like 'be warned" or "be guarded." I don't really understand that to be honest.</p>

            <p>ANYWAY. I will list some of the phrases I have so far (mostly what I assume to be nouns), not including the names I mentioned above. note that I have no idea what the word boundaries are yet! I will indicate a long pause with | because the children seemed to try to separate words for me, but I have no idea how accurate that is.</p>

            <p>(I know I said "all" before but. no. I do not have the energy for that and I want to get this out as soon as I can.)</p>

                        <p>The fruit had a hard shell and was soft inside when cooked. it was green-yellow like a banana but tasted more similar to a pineapple. Probably heavy in tartaric acid.</p>

            <p>If I'm being honest, for the time being, I'm not going to type up all my findings here; but I will plan out what images I want to print out for when I return this weekend. I want to have a list of nouns and test for things.</p>

            <p>At this point I am more confident that this is the phonology. but I am still not sure at all. expect more updates.</p>

            <br>

            <p>plosives become ejectives for emphasis or when a speaker is excited OR perhaps it's like baby talk or child talk? idk. Not sure if ʔ is a phoneme or if it is appended at the beginnings of words like in hebrew. though it is actually a phoneme in Hebrew I think. idk; I'll get more info on this later.</p>

            <p>I am pretty sure that tʃ is just palatalization because I have only ever seen it before i and I have never seen t before i. I'm going to go with that for now because palatalization is REALLY common. Reminds me of portuguese a little bit :D</p>

            <p>I think that w is just its own phoneme. Unless I find a minimal pair between like pw and pʷ I'm going to analyze it as just a consonant cluster (or maybe a diphthong? honestly this analysis doesn't matter too much)</p>

            <p>I am at this time not sure how phonemic the stress is. But then again, I'm not sure where the word boundaries or morpheme boundaries are. So Like™</p>

            <p>Images I want to have printed out: iconography of a single person, multiple people, a short person next to a tall person, a sarong next to a person wearing a sarong, some fruits from my world (I can just bring these I think?), a table, a bowl, a fork (they did have forks, spoons, knives, and sticks that resemble chopsticks, so maybe I will just point at the ones that they have. They have bowls too actually. and tables.) I'm planning on pointing at the sun and having them tell me what it's called. I will ask them about rocks, I will bring water, I will ask them about fire (they had a fire going, which is how they cooked the fruit for me). I'll share more details tomorrow if I get the chance (even though it will be shabes and I think there's a service this week).</p>
