            <summary id="introduction-who">Who</summary>
            <p>This grammar was written by lipamanka, known among the Qwamaq as "Toraper." Toraper means "one who comes from another world" and the root "tora" comes directly from Dora Lipman's name. For the remainder of this grammar, lipamanka will be referred to as "Toraper." Toraper uses it/its pronouns in English.</p>

            <p>Lipamanka collaborated with Zhoniker when creating this grammar. Zhoniker is a native speaker of Qwamaq who speaks Qwamaq, Olsem, and Oriti as his first languages. Zhoniker uses he/him pronouns in English.</p>

            <p>Also in collaboration but less so are Akakiper, Zhoniker's grandmother (though kinship works differently for the Qwamaq, so this is somewhat misleading); Uqumer, Zhoniker's mother, and the children Ripiper and Usalamaper. I've been visiting them daily for the past two weeks documenting their language. Akakiper was particularly useful in some word etymologies, because she is quite venerable. (Her name literally means "rock-rock" because rocks are old)</p>

            <p>Qwamaq (called "Qwamaqifaq" or more formally "Qamifaq Paqwamaq" natively) is spoken by the Qwamaq (who call themselves "Anqwamaqer" natively). They live on Qwamaq land (known as "Qwamaqqar" natively). Many members of the Olsem (a nomadic ethnic group that lives in the mountains to the North) also speak Qwamaq.</p>

            <p>There is kind of a dialect continuüm? But it isn't based on from city to city, it's more based on how rural the speakers are. Rural dialects seem to be more conservative, according to Zhoniker. He told me that he spoke "like [his] grandmother" and that people in the cities talk weird. (He actually said that their version of Qwamaq was "set ablaze" which is fucking fantastic!)</p>

            <p>First published in October 2024. This is a living document though; last edited in October 2024. I will continue updating it (especially the dictionary part) as I learn more words and have the time to transcribe them. </p>

            <summary id="introduction-why">Why</summary>
            <p>I have an ongoing project where I document my efforts to find out what happened to my great great aunt, Dora Lipman. She went missing in 1953 and I've confirmed that she got stuck in this world after opening a portal.</p>

            <p>I want a reference document that not only I but also others can reference if they have questions about how Qwamaq works and want to parse snippets that I use in my journal so I don't have to gloss all of them.</p>

            <p>People have also said that they want to learn Qwamaq. Hopefully this will help them!</p>

        <p>Vowels: a e i o u</p>

        <p>All phonological rules are based on the completed forms of inflected words. That means that all affixes are appended to roots BEFORE any of these rules take place.</p>

        <p>There is one unordered phonological rule: DORSAL CONSONANT HARMONY. Backness spreads leftwards through dorsal plosives. Transparent to everything.</p>

        <p>As for ordered rules, first nasal assimilation. Nasal stops assimilate in place to any consonants that follow them. For whatever reason l is also part of this and becomes a nasal before another consonant. Before f, nasals and l become ɱ, and before q, nasals and l become ɴ. Nasals assimilate to m, n, and ŋ as well before bilabial, coronal, and velar sounds respectively.</p>

        <p>Next, syllabification occurs.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>CCVC</p></li>
            <li><p>appendix word finally; cannot be w, l, or r.</p></li>
            <li><p>onset cluster condition: second consonant in a cluster must be w, l, or ɾ; the first consonant in a cluster must be an obstruent</p></li>
            <li><p>coda condition: coda must be a place linked nasal or l or exactly the same as the sound that follows it (creating a geminate). (bleeding relationship with nasal assimilation)</p></li>
            <li><p>stray syllables fixed through epenthetic i and p; words lacking an initial onset are appended with a glottal stop.</p></li>
            <li><p>this has a bleeding relationship with nasal assimilation.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Then, labial consonant harmony: continuity spreads leftward between labial obstruents. Transparent to sonorants, opaque to obstruents. This rule has a feeding relationship with syllabification.</p>

        <img src="/images/labial_consonant_harmony.png" alt="A feature geometry diagram demonstrating labial consonant harmony." style="width: 100%">

        <p>Then, plosive dissimilation: If (ignoring vowels), three plosives in a row are of the same place of articulation, the middle one will become t. This has a feeding relationship with both the epenthesis in syllabification and labial consonant harmony.</p>

        <p>Then, palatalization: t becomes tʃ before i. This has a feeding relationship with plosive dissimilation.</p>

        <p>Any time after syllabification, stress patterning occurs. The first syllable of each morpheme receives secondary stress. The first syllable of the last morpheme receives primary stress. This has a feeding relationship with syllabification.</p>

        <p>My collaborator (Zhoniker) is from a small town called Matar, but he made an impression of urban Qwamaq for me. It seems that the major difference is that all vowels become o before uvular consonants. This has a feeding/bleeding relationship with dorsal consonant harmony. They also use [h] word initially where rural Qwamaq would use [ʔ].</p>
