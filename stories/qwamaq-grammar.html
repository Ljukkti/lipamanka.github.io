            <summary id="introduction-who">Who</summary>
            <p>This grammar was written by lipamanka, known among the Qwamaq as "Toraper." Toraper means "one who comes from another world" and the root "tora" comes directly from Dora Lipman's name. For the remainder of this grammar, lipamanka will be referred to as "Toraper." Toraper uses it/its pronouns in English.</p>

            <p>Lipamanka collaborated with Zhoniker when creating this grammar. Zhoniker is a native speaker of Qwamaq who speaks Qwamaq, Olsem, and Oriti as his first languages. Zhoniker uses he/him pronouns in English.</p>

            <p>Also in collaboration but less so are Akakiper, Zhoniker's grandmother (though kinship works differently for the Qwamaq, so this is somewhat misleading); Uqumer, Zhoniker's mother, and the children Ripiper and Usalamaper. I've been visiting them daily for the past two weeks documenting their language. Akakiper was particularly useful in some word etymologies, because she is quite venerable. (Her name literally means "rock-rock" because rocks are old)</p>

            <p>Qwamaq (called "Qwamaqifaq" or more formally "Qamifaq Paqwamaq" natively) is spoken by the Qwamaq (who call themselves "Anqwamaqer" natively). They live on Qwamaq land (known as "Qwamaqqar" natively). Many members of the Olsem (a nomadic ethnic group that lives in the mountains to the North) also speak Qwamaq.</p>

            <p>There is kind of a dialect continuüm? But it isn't based on from city to city, it's more based on how rural the speakers are. Rural dialects seem to be more conservative, according to Zhoniker. He told me that he spoke "like [his] grandmother" and that people in the cities talk weird. (He actually said that their version of Qwamaq was "set ablaze" which is fucking fantastic!)</p>

            <p>First published in October 2024. This is a living document though; last edited in October 2024. I will continue updating it (especially the dictionary part) as I learn more words and have the time to transcribe them. </p>

            <summary id="introduction-why">Why</summary>
            <p>I have an ongoing project where I document my efforts to find out what happened to my great great aunt, Dora Lipman. She went missing in 1953 and I've confirmed that she got stuck in this world after opening a portal.</p>

            <p>I want a reference document that not only I but also others can reference if they have questions about how Qwamaq works and want to parse snippets that I use in my journal so I don't have to gloss all of them.</p>

            <p>People have also said that they want to learn Qwamaq. Hopefully this will help them!</p>

        <p>Vowels: a e i o u</p>

        <p>All phonological rules are based on the completed forms of inflected words. That means that all affixes are appended to roots BEFORE any of these rules take place.</p>

        <p>There is one unordered phonological rule: DORSAL CONSONANT HARMONY. Backness spreads leftwards through dorsal plosives. Transparent to everything.</p>

        <p>As for ordered rules, first nasal assimilation. Nasal stops assimilate in place to any consonants that follow them. For whatever reason l is also part of this and becomes a nasal before another consonant. Before f, nasals and l become ɱ, and before q, nasals and l become ɴ. Nasals and l assimilate to m, n, and ŋ as well before bilabial, coronal, and velar sounds respectively.</p>

        <p>Next, syllabification occurs.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>CCVC</p></li>
            <li><p>appendix word finally; cannot be w, l, or r.</p></li>
            <li><p>onset cluster condition: second consonant in a cluster must be w, l, or ɾ; the first consonant in a cluster must be an obstruent</p></li>
            <li><p>coda condition: coda must be a place linked nasal or l or exactly the same as the sound that follows it (creating a geminate). (bleeding relationship with nasal assimilation)</p></li>
            <li><p>stray syllables fixed through epenthetic i and p; words lacking an initial onset are appended with a glottal stop.</p></li>
            <li><p>this has a bleeding relationship with nasal assimilation.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Then, labial consonant harmony: continuity spreads leftward between labial obstruents. Transparent to sonorants, opaque to obstruents. This rule has a feeding relationship with syllabification.</p>

        <img src="/images/labial_consonant_harmony.png" alt="A feature geometry diagram demonstrating labial consonant harmony." style="width: 50%">

        <p>Then, plosive dissimilation: If (ignoring vowels), three plosives in a row are of the same place of articulation, the middle one will become t. This has a feeding relationship with both the epenthesis in syllabification and labial consonant harmony.</p>

        <p>Then, palatalization: t becomes tʃ before i. This has a feeding relationship with plosive dissimilation.</p>

        <p>Any time after syllabification, stress patterning occurs. The first syllable of each morpheme receives secondary stress. The first syllable of the last morpheme receives primary stress. This has a feeding relationship with syllabification.</p>

        <p>My collaborator (Zhoniker) is from a small town called Matar, but he made an impression of urban Qwamaq for me. It seems that the major difference is that all vowels become o before uvular consonants. This has a feeding/bleeding relationship with dorsal consonant harmony. They also use [h] word initially where rural Qwamaq would use [ʔ].</p>

            <p>Lexically, Qwamaq has pronouns, verbs, adverbs, and prepositions. Surprisingly, there are no exceptions to this rule! This means that all roots with semantic meaning are either a verb or an adverb. There are also numbers. I'm going to define these lexical word classes below.</p>

            <p>However, Qwamaq doesn't entirely lack nouns or adjectives. Qwamaq features a lot of nominalizers that are usually suffixes (but sometimes circumfixes, and there may be one prefix I've noticed so far). There are also adjectivizers.  There are productive, semi-productive, and nonproductive affixes.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Nonproductive affixes are affixes that are only used in specific lexicalized compounds and are never used in neologisms.</p></li>
                <li><p>Semi-productive affixes are used in many lexicalized compounds and are used to form neologisms, but cannot be used without creating a new lexical entry.</p></li>
                <li><p>Productive affixes are used all the time without creating a new lexical entry. </p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>My methodology for judging productivity was pretty simple:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>I tried using these affixes in productive ways that I came up with and saw if I got corrected or not (they treated me like a child speaker and corrected me when I said something that was wrong)</p></li>
                <li><p>I introduced them to things from my world and discovered how they created neologisms for them</p></li>
                <li><p>I suggested my own neologisms for objects from my world and paid attention to their reactions</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>I will say that my analysis of parts of speech in Qwamaq is a little abstract. None of these verb roots  appear on their own. They are ALL bound morphemes. Some of them I've never heard used as verbs and only in nominalizations. But my analysis is extremely consistent, which is why I'm using it.</p>

            <p>Stative verbs can be appended in between a root and a nominalizer to incorporate as an adjective or a patient of the verb. For example, a root with a meaning for "to be red" can be put between a verb meaning "to beat with a stick" and the instrumental nominalizer, becoming "red stick." Alternatively, a common name for children is /usala-ma-er/ [ˌusalamaˈper], where "usala" means "climb (transitive)" and "ma" means "tree," so the name is something close to "tree climber." This is completely productive, but some compounds created this way have become lexicalized and cannot have productive meanings.</p>

            <p>When I make a dictionary for the language I will try my best to include all of the lexicalized compounds I can, mostly for myself but also for anyone who wants to learn Qwamaq.</p>

            <p>It is by far more common to see stative verbs with descriptor meanings incorporated into nouns like this than to see them relativized as verbs with /maf-/, but both are common. Zhoniker says that in urban dialects, /maf-/ constructions are actually more common, and the demonstrative infix is shortened from /C-wik-V/ to /C-w-V/ because relative clauses are more common. /maf-/ is also shortened to /f-/.</p>

            <p>All nouns, some adjective forms, some adjectives, and some verbs are derived using these affixes. Nouns are derived with nominalizer affixes. Some adjective forms are derived from either verbs or nouns using adjectivizer affixes. The meanings of verbs can be changed with some affixes as well.</p>

            <p>I've separated these into three categories: general, specialized, and archaic. General ones are used frequently with general meanings, specialized ones are more specific, and archaic ones only exist in older lexicalized compounds.</p>

            <p>There is also the interrogative pronoun /fol/</p>

            <p>The infix /C-wik-V/ is a demonstrative that is appended after a consonant and before the first vowel after a consonant in a word. (So if the word starts with a vowel in UR, it will be appended before the second vowel). Speakers avoid using this though, this type of infixation in the middle of a morpheme is weeeiirrdd.</p>

            <p>This is also one reason why people avoid relative clauses when possible and use things like parataxis instead; This infix must be added to the word being relativized.</p>

            <p>Urban speakers, according to Zhoniker, don't avoid /C-wik-V/ (which is shortened to /C-w-V/) anyway as mentioned above.</p>

            <summary id="numbers">Numbers</summary>

            <p>The Qwamaq seem to have some sort of base 20 number system, but they hardly ever use it day to day and instead opt for using ʃul and ʃuʃul (many and a large quantity, respectively), and often ʃulum or ʃuʃulum when embedded (not many, not a large quantity). While these quantifiers are not often embedded, I have yet to see the numbers not embedded. Below are infixes in underlying representation.</p>

            <p>As far as I can tell, there is no difference between cardinal and ordinal numbers and it's just up to context. The fifth pig assumes that there are five of them, I suppose? This has led to some confusion though and I don't yet know how the Qwamaq resolve it.</p>

            <p>Note that kapi is /kaCi/ underlyingly and the C assimilates to the following consonant (after syllabification) when embedded. This took me a while to figure out because of how uncommon numbers are.</p>

            <summary id="prepositions">Prepositions</summary>

            <p>There are actually a lot of these as far as I can tell, but speakers avoid most of them like the plague. The ones that you will likely see in every conversation are:</p>

            <table style="width: 35%">
                <tr>
                    <th>case</th>
                    <th>noun phrase</th>
                    <th>clause</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>direct</td>
                    <td>fu</td>
                    <td>fufu</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>indirect</td>
                    <td>tar</td>
                    <td>tatar</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>oblique</td>
                    <td>fim</td>
                    <td>fimfim</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The "clause" column is for reduplicated forms of each preposition, which are used when the prepositional object is an embedded clause. (The first m in fimfim is actually pronounced [ɱ] which is fun! But this is common in any language that allows a labial nasal to occur before a labiodental fricative.) When speaking quickly people shorten fimfim to fifi which is really cute.</p>

            <p>ALSO! It may make more sense to analyze fim as a prefix because the m assimilates to consonants that follow it during nasal assimilation, which normally doesn't happen over word boundaries (otherwise I'd expect liaison instead of glottal onset).</p>

            <p>Others I've seen are: emi (comparative "like" "as"), ʃu (locative "in" "on" "at" "about" "with" "alongside"), en (dative "to" "towards" "for"), fo (ablative "from" "because"), and or (instrumental "using"). There may be more. But speakers do really avoid using these.</p>

            <p>Zhoniker says that in urban dialects they are more likely to use them? But I don't really know how true that is because I haven't been anywhere except for Matar (the name of the small village Zhoniker is from). I wonder how common reduplicated versions of these are and what they look like! Once I have urban dialect exposure I may update this section.</p>

            <summary id="intensification">Intensification</summary>
        
            <p>The most common intensifier is to code switch into "young speech" (see the registers and varieties section for more info) and pronouncing the intensified word with ejectives. This causes people to sometimes found roundabout ways of talking about things they want to intensify if they don't have a plosive in them, but most nouns have a plosive in them (through epenthesis or in the nominalizer), so it usually isn't too much trouble. Speakers will also ejectivize other obstruents, and devoice ʒ in order to do this. This means that ejectives are like, kind of phonemic? But that is a weird analysis in my opinion.</p>

            <p>Another way is to modify a noun with ʒir, which people resort to sometimes when a noun doesn't have any plosives to ejectivize.</p>
