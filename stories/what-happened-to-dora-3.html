    <ul>
    <li><p>I found a book while looking through my grandfather's things that gave instructions to open a gateway to another world.</p></li>
    <li><p>Through the gateway, I met Zhoniker and his family, members of the Qwamaq ethnic group and speakers of the Qwamaq language.</p></li>
    <li><p>Zhoniker and I went to a large city called Konoprar and moved in with Zhoniker's bio father.</p></li>
    <li><p>A wisdom holder of the city showed me a document about my great great aunt Dora Lipman, who went missing in 1953. The document mentioned that she may move to a different city called Ullipar.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>It's been a busy couple of months! Finals caught up to me. I think I did well enough. In any case, I should give a brief update on what's been going on with Zhoniker and Qwamaqqar. </p>
    
    <p>Zhoniker has been teaching me a very small amount of Olsem. My Olsem is still pretty bad, but at this point it's safe to say that Olsem and Qwamaq are related. They both have trigger systems, and the classifiers in Olsem very closely remember the nominalizers in Qwamaq.</p>
    
    <p>The most apt example of this I can think of right now is fek, which is a classifier for tools. In Qwamaq, /-faq/ is an instrumental nominalizer suffix. There are some ones that may be related but seem more opaque.</p>
    
    <p>Olsem also has a noun class system. I still can't figure out if it has any basis or is completely arbitrary, but apparently I am in class A, along with every other person i've met except for some Olsem who are in class B. Though people in class B are sometimes in class A. That is the only reasonable pattern I've been able to find, all other objects seem to be arbitrary.</p>
    
    <p>So why am I learning Olsem? Pretty simple! Actually no it's very complicated. So let me run over what happened. Zhoniker and I went back to Porer after I finished translating the document about Dora, and I asked her where further information would be. She took me down a different path in the catacombs, but in the room she took me to, the tablet she was looking for had gone missing. After looking around for it in the room, she noticed a coin on the floor.</p>
    
    <p>Apparently, these coins belong to Olsem families. They mint these coins and carry them in pouches. They're not really used for trade, but the more you have from your own family, the more status you have within that family. Olsem families are apparently pretty large. If you kill someone from a different family, you must carry all of their coins with your own. Killing other Olsem (and killing in general) is taboo. Manslaughter is considered different, I think? I may elaborate if and when I meet an Olsem person who can explain it to me.</p>
    
    <p>But what's relevant here is that whoever took this second document likely dropped this coin. some Olsem have been known to steal from the catacombs and sell documents to other Olsem to put in their "mountain home," which is a place in the mountains where the Olsem return to for the â€¦ winter solstice? There are two solstices of course but I'm not sure which one just happened a couple of months ago. They keep family belongings that they can't bring with them in special sacred hiding spots, basically. They are normally nomadic and move every four days, but they stay in their mountain home for a whole month. They decorate their camps with all sorts of treasures. Qwamaq tablets are prized decorations.</p>
    
    <p>So essentially, I will need to journey to the mountains with Zhoniker. We will have to bring the door with us so I can easily return home, which sounds really inconvenient, and we'll need to get there before the next solstice (the mountain one). But most Olsem are apparently really strong. Must be carrying all those things around with them all the time. So Zhoniker is looking around town for an Olsem guide. We will leave within four days.</p>
    
    <p>Before I leave though, I have been wanting to meet with the fortune teller. I have seen magic working in real time here, and if there's a chance I can learn more about what happened to Dora from this, I should try it out. Potentially, I'd like to visit the house of relics to see if they have anything before I leave Konoprar for the mountains. Zhoniker has confirmed to me that such a fortune teller exists, and that they he can take me to them.</p>
    
    <p>Now I'm thinking: what if I make a much lighter door so Zhoniker and I can carry it around with us? like an inflatable one or something that can unfold or something? That way, we can have access to Matar and Konoprar, as well as wherever Zhoniker is at the time, all through my world. idk how doable that is. Signing off for now.</p>
