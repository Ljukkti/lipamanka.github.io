        <summary id="recap">Recap (Oct 15 2024)</summary>

        <p>Here is a quick synopsis of what has happened so far.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>I found a very old book written in Biblical Hebrew. With it was a notebook written in cursive yiddish detailing instructions on how to open a gateway to another world, written by my great great aunt, Dora Lipman.</p></li>
            <li><p>I successfully opened a gateway to Qwamaqqar, the land of the Qwamaq people. The portal opened into a small farming village called Matar.</p></li>
            <li><p>I started to collect language samples and analyze their language while getting to know them better.</p></li>
            <li><p>Zhoniker ("walker") is a songwalker who lives with his mother Uqumer ("woodworker") and his grandmother Akakiper (a reduplicated version of the word for "rock"). They also raise two children together named Usalamaper ("tree-climber") and Ripiper ("trickster").</p></li>
            <li><p>Zhoniker, Uqumer, and Akakiper told me that Akakiper used to be well acquainted with Dora Lipman, who showed up in this world a very long time ago.</p></li>
            <li><p>The Oriti are an ethnic group from a different place who are occupying most of eastern Qwamaq land. They do not treat the Qwamaq well and do not let non-Oriti people enter and leave their capital city, which the Qwamaq call "Oritshipar"</p></li>
            <li><p>At least a few decades ago, Dora moved to Oritshipar BEFORE Oriti occupation, and the Oriti occupation began while she was still living there. Nobody knows what happened to Dora, but  she probably wasn't allowed to leave Oritshipar.</p></li>
            <li><p>Akakiper told me that in order to find out what happened to Dora, I needed to visit the city Konoprar (/konopr/ means "to rise," so the city's name would translate to "Rising City." Not sure why yet).</p></li>
        </ul>

        

        <p>It has been several days since my last journal entry. In the meantime, I've completed a full grammar for the Qwamaq language (which can be found <a href="/stories/qwamaq-grammar">here</a>). Going forward I will be writing the Qwamaq with an English translation in parentheses. I have a lot to share soon about what else I've been doing. Stay tuned for Oct 16, 2024!</p>

        <summary id="oct-16">Oct 16 2024 11:15 AM</summary>
        
        <p>By pure chance I found a door just on the ground outside. Here's a picture from when I found it:</p>
        
        <img src="/images/door.jpeg" alt="a door laying against a tree in Saint Paul, Minnesota, not in a door frame" style="width: 100%">
        
        <p>If you don't believe me, try reverse image searching the image. Nothing will come up, because I took that picture!</p>
        
        <p>I've done some experiments using the door and some translation of the Hebrew book. I think I've found out something very interesting about how doors relate to gateways. So I tried using the magic circles on several door-like objects:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Windows! Didn't work at all at first, but if I close my eyes, when I open the windows, they lead to Qwamaqqar. But they usually open into the interiors of cupboards.</p></li>
            <li><p>Naturally, I tried cupboards in my own home next. And drawers. The drawers led to the interior closed pots (and the shape seemed kind of warped? I couldn't test it out because all of my drawers led to pots that were very hot. smelled good tho.) </p></li>
            <li><p>Next I tried making my own small door out of cardboard as a proof of concept. It was about the size of an index card and it opened into the hole in a tree. I kept it open and put it next to my wifi router. I wrapped it in cheesecloth so bugs and stuff couldn't move back and forth freely. If I ever find a hole in a tree with cheesecloth inside of it, I'll see if I can't get Uqumer (who is a woodworker) to remove it from the tree so I can have wifi wherever I go in Qwamaqqar.</p></li>
            <li><p>I tried one of my friend's garage door, and when it opened up, it opened between two trees in the middle of a forest near Matar. The warping I mentioned for the drawers was full swing here. So, if I hypothetically needed to get a vehicle or large animal or something very large through, I could use a garage door.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The only consistency here is that gateways always open to the same places. They seem to be tied together in some VERY hard to decipher network, so I'm not sure how to make sense of it. I've tried drawing maps of where the doors are in both worlds and it doesn't match up 1:1, just by general area, but none of them really make sense. Two doors in my own home open to doors on opposite ends of Matar, which is a large (but very spread out and rural) city. One of the doors in Uqumer's house leads to someone's bathroom in Minneapolis (according to google maps), which is, given, only technically a different city from the one I live in, still different enough that this was surprising to me.</p>
        
        <p>I shouldn't be that surprised though. I don't know why I assumed these gateways would be the same as nether portals lmao.</p>
        
        <p>Then I brought Zhoniker with me to my world for the first time, to help transport the door I found through a gateway. I also showed him my spice collection, which he thought was interesting. Maybe one day I'll sit down with him and Akakiper and see what neologisms* they come up with. The door from my world is resting in Zhoniker's home right now. I have no idea what it'll do because it's not attached to a door frame, but Uqumer has my permission to try doing something with it.</p>
        
        <p>While learning to cook Qwamaq food**, I've talked to Uqumer about transporting the door to their home with the doorframe to Konoprar so I can visit Konoprar, but she seems to be against the idea. At this point in time I think these are my options:<p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Find out somewhere in my world that leads to Konoprar, and visit Konoprar from that location</p></li>
            <li><p>Wait until fall break or winter break and spend my time visiting Konoprar and exploring/sleuthing. (This ideally requires that I've found the wifi cheesecloth treehole by the time fall break starts, and I'm not sure how plausible that is.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Find some doorframe in Matar that leads to another door either in my house, a friend's house, or somewhere on my campus, and transport it physically to Konoprar, or have someone else transport it.</p></li>
            <li><p>Try to decipher the original Hebrew book more and figure out if I can change the location of the gateway somehow.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I don't know which of these I'm going to go for. Option 2 seems the most reliable and simple, but I would have to wait a while. I don't have a car, so option 1 would be difficult. Option 4 seems the hardest, and Option 3 seems potentially too much to ask for Uqumer and Zhoniker. I may run it by Zhoniker but idk.</p>
        
        <p>I also don't know for SURE that moving a doorframe doesn't change where the portal opens up, but once the portal is ALREADY open, I know that the doorframe can be moved around (from the small cardboard one I made).</p>
        
        <p>Not sure where to go from here, but I have been doing more than just playing around with the gateways. I've been spending a lot of time with Zhoniker. He's tattooed me, which means we're in some sort of queerplatonic-esque relationship.</p>
        
        <p>My fall break actually starts tomorrow, and I have until the 21st to finish, so we should probably act fast.</p>

        <summary>*Tangent: Qwamaq Neologisms and Sociolinguistics</summary>
        
            <p>I talked about this in my full grammatical analysis of Qwamaq. the Qwamaq seem to care a LOT about getting neologisms right, and it plays into their social hierarchy (which is based on how many tattoos you have). Here is an excerpt from my grammar:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
            
                <p>It should be noted that when it comes to neologisms, it's expected for the member of the group with the most tattoos to decide for the whole group. Whenever I would show something new to the family I've been spending time with, everyone would always look to Akakiper. If she wasn't there, people looked to Uqumer instead, but Uqumer would frequently feel obligated to GO FIND Akakiper to ask her. It's really sweet how much they care about doing neologisms RIGHT. </p>
                
                <p>They actually prioritize getting Akakiper to come up with neologisms over things like tending to food to keep it from burning. One time, Umuqer instructed me to get Ripiper, who was playing outside. (Zhoniker and Usalamaper were off somewhere and I was helping out around the house.) Then, Umuqer asked Ripiper to get Akakiper.</p>
                
                <p>Why she didn't just ask me is beyond me, but it could be because Akakiper is a very respected member of the family and I only had one tattoo at the time, which was faint and covered up on my left shoulder. None of them had ever seen it. So formality-wise, I'm only slightly a rung up from the children, or perhaps even below because I'm not Qwamaq.</p>
            
            </blockquote>

            <summary>**Tangent: Learning Qwamaq cooking</summary>
            
            <p>
            
            <p>Traditional Qwamaq cooking is pretty damn good. Uqumer uses three ingredients in most of her meals, each of which are either definitely in the same genus or cultivars of the same species. The first one, tumpasekiser ("long-fruit"), resembles a banana, but the inside appears drier. The Qwamaq beat it until it turns into a paste, which becomes very moist. They base most of their sauces on this fruit. On its own it barely has any flavor, but it feels very tannic and astringent if consumed without being beaten. It mellows out significantly. I am assuming that this is due to like enzymes or something.</p>
            
            <p>Most cooking starts with some sort of oil. I'm not sure where it comes from, but Uqumer says it comes from a tree far away. Not sure what that means at all, because whenever I ask her to clarify she just repeats "from a tree far away" ("maqoˈmer" /ma-qom-er/ ma is tree and qom is distant). But it's probably plant based? Anyway it's solid at room temperature (similar to ghee or niter kibbeh, but with a neutral flavor) and melts very quickly at body temperature, so it Uqumer usually uses a knife to cut pieces off directly into the pan.</p> 
            
            <p>Then Uqumer usually adds an allium that looks like if fennel was an allium instead of a member of the carrot family. She cuts the root off, allowing multiple… like flat bits? Of the white stuff. Circular but they grow into breen fronds. But she cuts the root off, allowing multiple of those to fall apart and then she cuts off the fronds. She gives them a few coarse chops either way and adds them to the hot oil. She immediately pours over a liquid that I've tasted before. It tastes like really salty salt water, but it also tastes… fermented. Slightly. And umami. Kind of in the same way soy sauce is but completely different. </p>
            
            <p>Once fragrant, she will usually add the second of the three ingredients I mentioned at the beginning, tumpapalaper ("dance-fruit"). This contains either the same or a similar compound to the one found in szechuan peppercorns, because it has the same effect on the tongue. It's what they use to make food taste "spicy" here. They grow small and are red, kind of like chili peppers, but the internal structure is completely different. They're filled with a powder that Uqumer tells me is a pulp before it is dried, and that when it's pulpy it doesn't "make the mouth dance." She also adds some seeds that look similar to cumin or caraway seeds but smell somewhat different.</p>
            
            <p>She then adds the paste from one or two tumpasekiser (the long-fruit), which releases a lot of moisture immediately. It must have some emulsifiers in it because soon the oil is nowhere to be found and the sauce becomes a cohesive mass.</p>
            
            <p>She removes the sauce from the heat and cooks some of the third of the three ingredients I mentioned: tumpamontiper ("wet-fruit"). This is the first thing I ever tasted in Qwamaqqar. It's juicy and savory but also sweet. Uqumer grills it in the oil with a root vegetable and some sort of gourd I don't recognize before adding them directly to the sauce and serving with a squeeze of a citrus that looks like a cross between a lemon and an orange.</p>
            
            <p>This is a pretty typical Qwamaq meal. It's fragrant and well seasoned in every way I can imagine. It's really good! I have no idea how to replicate the recipe yet using stuff from our world, but I assume I'd have to use some sort of starch to create the sauce, and perhaps I would need egg yolk or some other strong emulsifier. I could replace the allium with onion pretty easily, use soy sauce for the liquid, and cook it in coconut oil? maybe? And use banana, squash, and parsnips or carrots or potatoes or all of the above. If I get a chance to try it out I will!</p>

        <p>Zhoniker and I have come up with a plan.</p>

        <p>First, we installed the door I brought from my world in a random doorframe in Matar. (Well; Uqumer made a doorframe for us and put it outside leaning against the wall.) I tested out my gateway magic circle on it and it opened into someone's front door a few blocks down. Luckily, I'm well acquainted with most of my neighbors, and this was one of them. His name is Scott and he grows peppers in his front yard. He's let me take a few of them, and they're very good!</p>

        <p>I showed him how the gateways worked and he gave me the key.</p>

        <p>The next step was moving the doorframe INSIDE Qwamaqqar. Luckily, when we walked with it about a half a mile towards Konoprar, it opened to the same door in Minnesota. So with a little luck, if Zhoniker brings the door with him to Konoprar, I should have access to Konoprar AND Matar without having to travel far in Minnesota.</p>

        <p>I've also found the cheesecloth gateway! It's in a tree growing in Uqumer's backyard. She has graciously been working on making the small gateway portable, i.e. sawing it out of the tree so it can be put a bag. Once she finishes it, I'll see what happens when I bring it through a portal back to Minnesota. I postulate that this will allow me to connect to my home wifi from anywhere, but I don't know if the gateways work once moved into a different world, or what happens if I do this while the gateway is open.</p>

        <p>After we confirmed that the new doorframe worked, Zhoniker told me "aʃaˈsel wokaˈpel fu Konoprar tar qaˈmer paˈpiʃ" (I will bring your door to Konoprar). Something they don't tell you is that doors are HEAVY, but Zhoniker and I can move it together if we take breaks! We are planning on starting this trek tomorrow in the afternoon. I have never slept in Qwamaqqar before, so we'll see how it goes! If I need to, I can return home at any time by opening the door to Scott's house and walking down the block to my home. It's a little jank but we'll have to work with it!</p>

        <p>I don't foresee needing to return home during the journey to Konoprar, but that doesn't really matter too much because Uqumer will be done with the portable cheesecloth gateway by then, and I'll be able to send updates on my way to Konoprar.</p>

        <p>Zhoniker told me "esˈsel fu pompompeler ampar fiŋ Konoprar ˌʃannaˈŋapa" (We will reach Konoprar in two days on foot).</p>

        <p class="note">Note that pompompeler is /poŋ-poŋ-pel-er/. poŋer means "to be a square," and Akakiper has told me that pompoŋer used to mean "eight day cycle" when she was a child, but now just means "day." ʃannaŋapa means "like a string," and it's also used to mean "in single file."</p>

        <p>So we should have arrived by the end of the day on Sunday, and I will be back home in time for classes! I'm very excited to make the trek. I wonder what we'll run into on the way.</p>

        <details closed>
            <summary>More info on how doors and dwellings work in Qwamaq culture</summary>
            
            <p>The Qwamaq word for door is "qamer," which comes from the root "qam," which means "to enter into a home." The interior is "qamel" (with the dative nominalizer), which means the sentence "aʃaˈqam fu qaˈmel tar qaˈmar" means "The door opens into the interior."</p>
            
            <p>The Qwamaq make their homes out of twigs and mud. The land is cold, but the sun is hot, and the air is dry, so mud dries fast and hard. They have little circles drawn all over the house, and Uqumer says that each circle is the home for a small spirit (natal-er) that keeps the home from falling apart. The house that all five people live in belongs to Uqumer, who made it while she was pregnant with Zhoniker. 
            
            The doorway of the dwelling opens down because the house itself is built over a hole in the ground. The hole is piled over with stones. Uqumer showed me the bottom of a few of these stones. Each one has a circle carved into it. The care that goes into creating a dwelling is incredible. The spirits are said to keep the stones clean, though I see Uqumer cleaning them a lot.</p>
            
            <p>The most remarkable thing about these stones is that they fit together perfectly. I couldn't fathom how this happened, so I tried my best to ask using the vocabulary I had:</p>
            
            <p>"ˈtulum akiˌʃulˈper pʼalaŋˈŋapʼa fimol?" (why do all these stones come together so well?)</p>
            
            <p class="note">Note that I'm using ejectives for emphasis. This is technically code switching into "young speech." Also note the infixed ʃul in "akiper." That turns "rock" into "many rocks." If I wanted to emphasize the amount more I could have reduplicated the ʃu part. Uqumer doesn't correct me as much as Zhoniker and Akakiper and the kids do, but Usalamaper was in the same room and they are often zealous about correcting me when is say something weird, so I'm confident that this is a normal enough thing to say.</p>
            
            <p>Uqumer responded by saying "fifi ˈtinus tar nataˈler paˌpakiˈper fu ipiˈper fifi aʃaˈʃaŋŋa ampi tar Zhonike ." (because the spirits of the stones are comfortable because Zhoniker sings to them).</p>
            
            <p>This is actually an idiomatic expression! "tinus fu ipiper" is literally "breath a close thing," but the meaning of the phrase is "to be comfortable in one's surroundings." Also hearing the word "akiper" used to talk about rocks is interesting because that's where Akakiper's name comes from. Note that this sentence starts with "fifi," which means that it is an addendum to my sentence. This is how people normally say "because" in Qwamaq after someone asks "why" (fimol).</p>
            
            <p>So I suppose the rocks changed shape to fit nicely with each other because the spirits in the rocks feel at home. That's really fun! I believe her; I've seen things happen when the spirits get petitioned (the Qwamaq word for petitioning is "kaʃi"), and the floor is remarkably smooth even when the stones have been proven to be separate and cut from different rocks (there are several different colors of stone).</p>
