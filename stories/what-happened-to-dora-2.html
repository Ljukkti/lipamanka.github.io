        <summary id="recap">Recap (Oct 15 2024)</summary>

        <p>Here is a quick synopsis of what has happened so far.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>I found a very old book written in Biblical Hebrew. With it was a notebook written in cursive yiddish detailing instructions on how to open a gateway to another world, written by my great great aunt, Dora Lipman.</p></li>
            <li><p>I successfully opened a gateway to Qwamaqqar, the land of the Qwamaq people. The portal opened into a small farming village called Matar.</p></li>
            <li><p>I started to collect language samples and analyze their language while getting to know them better.</p></li>
            <li><p>Zhoniker ("walker") is a songwalker who lives with his mother Uqumer ("woodworker") and his grandmother Akakiper (a reduplicated version of the word for "rock"). They also raise two children together named Usalamaper ("tree-climber") and Ripiper ("trickster").</p></li>
            <li><p>Zhoniker, Uqumer, and Akakiper told me that Akakiper used to be well acquainted with Dora Lipman, who showed up in this world a very long time ago.</p></li>
            <li><p>The Oriti are an ethnic group from a different place who are occupying most of eastern Qwamaq land. They do not treat the Qwamaq well and do not let non-Oriti people enter and leave their capital city, which the Qwamaq call "Oritshipar"</p></li>
            <li><p>At least a few decades ago, Dora moved to Oritshipar BEFORE Oriti occupation, and the Oriti occupation began while she was still living there. Nobody knows what happened to Dora, but  she probably wasn't allowed to leave Oritshipar.</p></li>
            <li><p>Akakiper told me that in order to find out what happened to Dora, I needed to visit the city Konoprar (/konopr/ means "to rise," so the city's name would translate to "Rising City." Not sure why yet).</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Part one, <em>the Qwamaq language,</em> can be found <a href="/stories/what-happened-to-dora">here</a>.</p>

        <p>It has been several days since my last journal entry. In the meantime, I've completed a full grammar for the Qwamaq language (which can be found <a href="/stories/qwamaq-grammar">here</a>). Going forward I will be writing the Qwamaq with an English translation in parentheses. I have a lot to share soon about what else I've been doing. Stay tuned for Oct 16, 2024!</p>
