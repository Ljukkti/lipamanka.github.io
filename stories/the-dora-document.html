    <h1>The Dora Document of Konoprar</h1>
    <p><a href='#/' id='expAll' class='col'>Expand/Collapse All</a></p>

    <p>This will serve as a record of my attempts to translate the document I've come to learn was written by Alaper Papanakiper Pakonoprar, a now passed wisdom holder of the city Konoprar, about Dora Lipman, my great great aunt. The document is held within the Catacombs of Konoprar. I am allowed to visit it whenever I want, but what I can bring with me is very limited. It is not socially acceptable to read the contents of the document out loud.</p>

    <p>Each entry will be a paragraph. I will provide phonetic, morphophonemic, and interlinear glosses for each of them and talk a bit about the writing system as I learn more.</p>

    <p>Here is, for your convenience, the entire document, vectorized.</p>

    <p>When I'm finished translating the whole thing, this paragraph will be replaced by a complete pragmatic translation.</p>

        <p><strong>Literal translation:</strong>They with-call me dancer of rock nation of rising city. I write Dora, said things of Dora, these things that in-said by rock nation of rising city.</p>

        <p><strong>Pragmatic translation:</strong> They call me Dancer of the Wisdom Holders of Konoprar. I write about Dora Lipman, her claims, and what the Wisdom Holders have to say about her.</p>

        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> I've noticed that the infix -wik- is put after the morpheme it's infixed in. This makes sense to me for a linear writing system. Not everything can be as cool as maya glyphs. Furthermore, the glyph for kataf (write) is the same as the glyph for ʒonik (walk). The only way to tell them apart is that the hebrew letter kaf appears before it when it means kataf, and the hebrew letter zayn appears before it when it means zhonik. This is kind of rebusy I guess? But the meanings are completely different.</p>

        <p>The glyph for "aki" is preceeded by kaf, which is weird because it starts with a, not k. I wonder if it skips over vowel for some reason. "aki" means both "rock" and "venerable," so it makes sense to me that the glyph looks like a spear a bit! qolin (to call someone by a name) kind of resembles a mouth? But it also resembles like a bull or something. konopr (to rise, to be born) resembles.. maybe a sunrise? I'm not really sure. The small circle that represents "ka" (to do something to something) appears to be exactly the same as a glyph I've seen for "egg" (puk), and it shows up once more later in the script with a shin before it, meaning it's also used to describe a third thing that starts with ʃ.</p>

        <p>"fu" is so common that at first I thought it had its own logograph, but it turns out that's just a bet-vav ligature! I see it doubled later for "fufu." It makes sentences and embedding really easy to parse because of how small and distinct it is. It seems like letters in the same common morphemes (derivational or inflectional ones, and also prepositions and pronouns) are combined together into ligatures whenever possible, but in roots without logograms (like tora), this doesn't happen, and glyphs don't get combined like this across morpheme boundaries.</p>

        <p>I would be so lost if they didn't use the alephbet.</p>
