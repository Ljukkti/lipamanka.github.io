    <h1>The Dora Document of Konoprar</h1>
    <p><a href='#/' id='expAll' class='col'>Expand/Collapse All</a></p>

    <p>This will serve as a record of my attempts to translate the document I've come to learn was written by Alaper Papanakiper Pakonoprar, a now passed wisdom holder of the city Konoprar, about Dora Lipman, my great great aunt. The document is held within the Catacombs of Konoprar. I am allowed to visit it whenever I want, but what I can bring with me is very limited. It is not socially acceptable to read the contents of the document out loud.</p>

    <p>Each entry will be a paragraph. I will provide phonetic, morphophonemic, and interlinear glosses for each of them and talk a bit about the writing system as I learn more.</p>

    <p>Here is, for your convenience, the entire document, vectorized.</p>

    <img src="/images/written-qwamaq/dora_document_1.svg" alt="A large document in a right to left writing system, resembling Hebrew." style="width: 100%">

    <p>When I'm finished translating the whole thing, this paragraph will be replaced by a complete pragmatic translation.</p>

        <p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> They with-call me dancer of rock nation of rising city. I write Dora, said things of Dora, these things that in-said by rock nation of rising city.</p>

        <p><strong>Pragmatic translation:</strong> They call me Dancer of the Wisdom Holders of Konoprar. I write about Dora Lipman, her claims, and what the Wisdom Holders have to say about her.</p>

        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> I've noticed that the infix -wik- is put after the morpheme it's infixed in. This makes sense to me for a linear writing system. Not everything can be as cool as maya glyphs. Furthermore, the glyph for kataf (write) is the same as the glyph for ʒonik (walk). The only way to tell them apart is that the hebrew letter kaf appears before it when it means kataf, and the hebrew letter zayn appears before it when it means zhonik. This is kind of rebusy I guess? But the meanings are completely different.</p>

        <p>The glyph for "aki" is preceeded by kaf, which is weird because it starts with a, not k. I wonder if it skips over vowel for some reason. "aki" means both "rock" and "venerable," so it makes sense to me that the glyph looks like a spear a bit! qolin (to call someone by a name) kind of resembles a mouth? But it also resembles like a bull or something. konopr (to rise, to be born) resembles.. maybe a sunrise? I'm not really sure. The small circle that represents "ka" (to do something to something) appears to be exactly the same as a glyph I've seen for "egg" (puk), and it shows up once more later in the script with a shin before it, meaning it's also used to describe a third thing that starts with ʃ.</p>

        <p>"fu" is so common that at first I thought it had its own logograph, but it turns out that's just a bet-vav ligature! I see it doubled later for "fufu." It makes sentences and embedding really easy to parse because of how small and distinct it is. It seems like letters in the same common morphemes (derivational or inflectional ones, and also prepositions and pronouns) are combined together into ligatures whenever possible, but in roots without logograms (like tora), this doesn't happen, and glyphs don't get combined like this across morpheme boundaries.</p>

        <p>I would be so lost if they didn't use the alephbet.</p>

        <p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Becomes a bad head, Dora. Qwamaq not her. It is fortunate that Oriti not her. in-thread not her Ishangep of-behind-desert. Like-pace hair of-her these spirits that are petitioned not. in-read me no-time a person. like-seem her the person.</p>

        <p><strong>Pragmatic translation:</strong> Dora is crazy. She is not Qwamaq, but she is not Horiti or Olsem either, neither is she from Ishangep beyond the desert. Her hair goes in circles like unpetitioned spirits. I have never seen someone who looks quite like her.</p>

        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> I missed a whole ass paragraph while transcribing and vectorizing originally. Not much new to say here about the writing system for the time being, but it seems like they believed dora was crazy and wasn't actually from another world. I asked Zhoniker what "hair pace in circles" meant and he told me it meant the hair spiraled (which has its own word, oli), i.e. curly hair. So I guess Dora had curly hair!</p>

        <p>I should note that the way you say someone is crazy or insane is "become a bad head." This took me a while to figure out because there's a lot of derivation and noun incorperation. It's weird! But I did figure it out.</p>

        <p>FURTHERMORE, there is a place to the south called "Ishangep." I asked Zhoniker about it and he said people live on giant rocks (akiʒiˈrer). Maybe I'll learn more about it?</p>

        <summary id="paragraph-four-five">Paragraph Four and Five (Nov 8 2:22 AM)</summary>

        <p>It's been a hot sec. Current events are frankly horrifying, and I have been spending. A Lot Of Time in Qwamaqqar. Not everyone is as lucky as me to have an escape, but the situation right now is so complex that I have not been able to successfully convey what's going on to Zhoniker or any other Qwamaq person. Maybe I'll get there eventually.</p>

        <p>In any case, here are paragraphs four and five.</p>

        <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> I am going to stop doing this part because it is too labor intensive and I have no reason to believe it is helpful to anyone. If you miss this part let me know and I'll see if I can't add it back.</p>

        <p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> threads her through a hole in fabric of the north of Konoprar. On-draws with charcol every day circles of Ishangep land with the writing of the Qwamaq ethnic group. The writing of Dora Lipman has not a had word and no had word. in places she the north of a door the circles. with petitions she a language that understand it no Qwamaq person. She opens the door. does she to all doors of Konoprar (and I may be exaggerating a bit).</p>

        <p><strong>Pragmatic translation:</strong> She sits in her dwelling in the northern part of the city all day long drawing with graphite circles containing nonsense syllables with the Qwamaq script, but without any word glyphs, just the sound glyphs (I think?). She places them against doors, chants in a language no Qwamaq understands, and opens the doors. She has certainly tried this with every door in the city by now.</p>

        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The phrase "of Ishangep" seems to be another way to say "crazy" or "nonsense" or something. I really need to learn more about the geography of Qwamaqqar and surrounding areas. In any case, it looks like she tried to return to our world from Konoprar and wasn't successful. She was likely chanting and writing in Hebrew. Also it's kind of funny how the glyph for "to be a square" is just a square. Also, reduplications don't seem to re-clarify with a letter what word the symbol represents. That's good to know!</p>

        <p><strong>Literal translation:</strong>I don't think this is true but I have no proof it isn't: She says that she threads herself from a place that is called with "place where ameri happens" from a place that is called with "place where ri happens of place where lafi happens." It is unfortuante that she speaks in an Ishangepi way. Not a person in here knows place of Dora.</p>

        <p><strong>Pragmatic translation:</strong> She claims to come from a land I think is called "Ameriqar" and moved there from a different land called "Riqar" in "Lafiqar." Though she slurs her words. Nobody here has heard of any of these places.</p>

        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> ... America? Latvia? Riga? Hmmmm. That is likely where she is from, but these could also just be outdated Qwamaq words. Not sure yet but probably the places she's from. Once again using "Ishangep" to mean "crazy" or "strange."</p>
